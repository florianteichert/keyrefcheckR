Current evidence shows an increase in the rate of nonunion after conservative treatment, suggesting that indications for conservative treatment may need to be re-examined. This article updates trends in treatment for humeral shaft fracture. Indications for surgery, both for plate osteosynthesis with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) as well as for minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) and intramedullary nailing (IMN) are described. Recognition of the advantages and disadvantages of each technique can better define the role of the plate or nail and can aid in the selection of an appropriate surgical approach. ORIF with compression plate continues to have a role in the treatment of simple or AO/OTA type A fractures. The primary goal of minimal invasive osteosynthesis, a surgical technique involving small incisions, closed reduction or mini-open reduction that minimizes soft tissue dissection and helps preserve the periosteal blood supply, is to achieve bone union and the best possible functional outcomes. MIPO of the humerus is now well accepted as being less invasive and providing relative stability to allow indirect (secondary) bone healing with callus formation. MIPO approaches can be performed circumferentially to the humerus, including the proximal, middle and distal shaft. The classic MIPO approach is anterior MIPO, followed by posterior, anterolateral and anteromedial MIPO. IMN is also an option for treating humerus fractures. In the past, IMN was not widely used due to the potential for complications such as shoulder impingement and elbow problems as well as the limited availability of implants and the steep learning curve of this surgical technique. Over the past decade, the launch of a new design of straight antegrade and retrograde IMN with established techniques has encouraged more surgeons to use IMN as an alternative option. Methods of dealing with concomitant and post-treatment radial nerve palsy have also been evolving, including the use of ultrasound for diagnosis of radial nerve conditions. Radial nerves with contusion, entrapment or laceration can be detected using ultrasound with reliability comparable to intraoperative findings. Trends in treatment of radial nerve palsy are described below. Future larger randomized controlled trials comparing conservative and operative management are necessary to further develop appropriate guidelines.",Conservative; Fracture; Humeral shaft; Intramedullary nailing; MIPO; ORIF; Radial nerve injury; Treatment; Ultrasound,"Department of Orthopaedics, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.",en,Review,NA

SETTING: We performed a content analysis of qualitative data collected in a randomised experiment. PARTICIPANTS: 2028 people with shoulder pain read a vignette describing someone with rotator cuff disease and were randomised to: bursitis label plus guideline-based advice, bursitis label plus treatment recommendation, rotator cuff tear label plus guideline-based advice and rotator cuff tear label plus treatment recommendation. Guideline-based advice included encouragement to stay active and positive prognostic information. Treatment recommendation emphasised that treatment is needed for recovery. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Participants answered questions about: (1) words/feelings evoked by the advice; (2) treatments they feel are needed. Two researchers developed coding frameworks to analyse responses. RESULTS: 1981 (97% of 2039 randomised) responses for each question were analysed. Guideline-based advice (vs treatment recommendation) more often elicited words/feelings of reassurance, having a minor issue, trust in expertise and feeling dismissed, and treatment needs of rest, activity modification, medication, wait and see, exercise and normal movements. Treatment recommendation (vs guideline-based advice) more often elicited words/feelings of needing treatment/investigation, psychological distress and having a serious issue, and treatment needs of injections, surgery, investigations, and to see a doctor. CONCLUSIONS: Words/feelings evoked by advice for rotator cuff disease and perceived treatment needs may explain why guideline-based advice reduces perceived need for unnecessary care compared to a treatment recommendation.",Elbow & shoulder; Musculoskeletal disorders; REHABILITATION MEDICINE; Rehabilitation medicine; Rheumatology,"Sydney Musculoskeletal Health, The University of Sydney and Sydney Local Health District, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.",en,Research Article,NA

Treatment can be surgical or non-surgical. Korean Medicine, including acupuncture and pharmacopuncture, is a part of conservative treatment. Pharmacopuncture, combining acupuncture with herbal medicine, has been used for musculoskeletal disorders since the 1960s, but clinical evidence on its effectiveness is lacking. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacopuncture for rotator cuff disease. METHODS: A two-group, parallel, single-center, pragmatic, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded trial will be conducted. A total of 40 patients will be recruited, starting in July 2022. All patients will be received acupuncture treatment, and pharmacopuncture will be applied to intervention group additionally. After eight treatments are delivered over four weeks, follow-up assessments will be performed. RESULTS: Assessments will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these treatments at baseline and at weeks 2 (2 W), 4 (4 W), and 8 (8 W). The primary outcome will be a visual analog scale (VAS) evaluation of shoulder pain levels. Assessments will include shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI), shoulder range of motion (ROM), EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L), patient global impression of change (PGIC), 'no worse than mild pain', and drug consumption rates.

Surgical protocols typically recommend surgery only after exhausting conservative measures; however, there is no consensus in the published literature detailing what constitutes conservative care ""best practice"" before undergoing surgery. PURPOSE: To describe conservative interventions received by individuals with SAPS prior to undergoing a SAD. STUDY DESIGN: Scoping review. METHODS: An electronic search using MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus databases was conducted. Peer-reviewed randomized controlled control trials and cohort studies published between January 2000 and February 2022 that included subjects diagnosed with SAPS who progressed to receive a SAD were eligible. Subjects who received previous or concurrent rotator cuff repair with SAPS were excluded. Conservative interventions and treatment details that subjects received prior to undergoing a SAD were extracted. RESULTS: Forty-seven studies were included after screening 1,426 studies. Thirty-six studies (76.6%) provided physical therapy (PT) services, and six studies (12.8%) included only a home exercise program. Twelve studies (25.5%) specifically detailed the delivered PT services, and 20 studies (42.6%) stated who provided the PT interventions. Subacromial injections (SI) (55.3%, n=26) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) (31.9%, n=15) were the next most frequently delivered interventions. Thirteen studies (27.7%) included combined PT and SI. The duration of conservative care varied from 1.5 months to 16 months. CONCLUSION: Conservative care that individuals with SAPS receive to prevent advancement to SAD appears inadequate based on the literature. Interventions, such as PT, SI, and NSAIDs, are either underreported or not offered to individuals with SAP prior to advancing to surgery. Many questions regarding optimal conservative management for SAPS persists.

However, few reviews have compared the effects of these 2 treatments. In this study, we compared the effects of PRP and corticosteroid injection on the prognosis of rotator cuff diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: According to the Cochrane Manual of Systematic Review of Interventions, the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched comprehensively. Two independent authors screened suitable studies and performed data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Only randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of PRP and corticosteroid in the treatment of rotator cuff injuries were included, as measured by clinical function and pain during different follow-up periods. RESULTS: Nine studies with 469 patients were included in this review. In short-term treatment, corticosteroids were superior to PRP in the improvement of Constant, Simple Shoulder Test, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores (mean difference [MD] -5.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] -10.26, 0.06; P = .05 and MD -0.97, 95% CI -1.68, -0.07; P = .03 and MD -6.67, 95% CI -12.85, -0.49; P = .03, respectively). No statistically significant difference was observed between the 2 groups at midterm (P > .05), and the recovery of the Simple Shoulder Test and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores in PRP treatment was significantly better than that in corticosteroid treatment in the long term (MD: 1.21, 95% CI: 0.68, 1.74; P .05). However, these differences did not reach the minimum clinically important difference. CONCLUSIONS: Current analysis showed that corticosteroids have better efficacy in short term, whereas PRP is more beneficial for long-term recovery. However, no difference was observed in the mid-term efficacy between the 2 groups.

Allogeneic PRP has been proven to be safe and effective in the treatment of osteoarthritis, rotator cuff disease, refractory wounds and other medical fields. However, a well-designed and long-term follow-up prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effect of allogeneic PRP intra-articular injections for KOA combined with hematologic blood dyscrasias has not yet been performed. METHODS/ DESIGN: We will conduct an allogeneic PRP injection for KOA combined with hematologic blood dyscrasias with platelet dysfunction study: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. One hundred participants with KOA combined with hematologic blood dyscrasias with platelet dysfunction will be randomly allocated to receive either one allogeneic PRP injection or one saline injection into the knee joint. The primary outcome will be a 12-month change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score. Secondary outcomes will be the 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36) score, Lysholm score, overall knee pain score and MRI assessment at 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare short-term clinical and radiological results of three surgical treatment options for these patients. METHODS: A multicenter randomized trial was conducted. Sixty-nine patients were randomly assigned to receive 1. subacromial decompression (Group SAD), 2. debridement of calcifications (Group D), or 3. debridement of calcifications with SAD (Group D + SAD). Stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria were used. The primary outcome was an improvement in VAS for pain (pVAS) 6 months postoperatively. Secondary outcomes were an improvement in pVAS 6 weeks postoperatively, functional outcomes (CMS, DASH, ASES), radiological outcome, additional treatments, and complications. RESULTS: The improvement in pVAS was significant in all groups (p < 0.001) and did not differ between the groups after 6 months. Six weeks postoperatively, the improvement in pVAS was significantly (p = 0.03) less in Group SAD compared to Group D + SAD (16.5 mm, SD 19.3 mm vs 33.1 mm, SD 19.7 mm, respectively). The mean size of calcifications decreased significantly in all groups (p < 0.0001). In Group SAD, the size of the calcifications decreased less (p = 0.04) compared to Group D and Group D + SAD after 6 weeks. Group SAD received more additional treatments (p = 0.003) compared to Group D + SAD (9 vs 1), which were mainly subacromial cortisone injections. CONCLUSIONS: All patient groups showed significant pain relief and an improvement in shoulder function 6 months after surgery. However, patients in Group SAD showed inferior pain relief and less improvement in DASH score after 6 weeks. Furthermore, this group required more postoperative additional treatments. No significant differences in clinical and radiological outcomes were observed between patients in Group D compared to Group D + SAD. Therefore, an arthroscopic debridement without subacromial decompression seems to be advisable for patients with therapy-resistant calcifying tendinitis of the shoulder.

METHODS: This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched from January 1, 1990, to March 20, 2022, for English-language randomized controlled trials that compared PRP and CS injections for patients with rotator cuff disease. Two evaluators independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed the level of evidence and methodologic quality of the enrolled studies. The meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan software (version 5.3.3). RESULTS: Thirteen nonsurgical randomized controlled trials with 725 patients were included. Compared with CS, PRP provided statistically worse short-term (<2 months) changes in American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) assessment scores, Simple Shoulder Test scores, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire scores but provided better medium-term (2-6 months) changes in Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores, as well as long-term (≥6 months) changes in Constant-Murley scores, ASES scores, and Simple Shoulder Test scores. No statistically significant differences regarding pain reduction were found between the 2 groups. PRP injections led to worse short-term changes in forward flexion and internal rotation but better medium-term changes in forward flexion and external rotation. PRP showed significantly lower rates of post-injection failure (requests for subsequent injections or surgical intervention prior to 12 months) than CS. No outcome reached the minimal clinically important difference. After sensitivity analyses excluding studies with substantial clinical and/or methodologic heterogeneity, PRP showed better medium-term changes in ASES scores and visual analog scale scores and long-term changes in visual analog scale scores that reached the minimal clinically important difference. CONCLUSIONS: Without the drawbacks of CS injection, PRP injection is not worse than CS injection in terms of pain relief and function recovery at any time point during follow-up. PRP injection may reduce rates of subsequent injection or surgery, and it might provide better improvements in pain and function in the medium to long term. PRP injection can be a viable alternative to CS injection for conservative treatment of rotator cuff disease.

METHODS: A systematic review of all clinical trials on subacromial impingement published from 1999 to 2020 was performed. Demographic, clinical, range of motion (ROM), and patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) data were collected. Interventions were compared via arm-based Bayesian network meta-analysis in a random-effects model and treatments ranked via surface under the cumulative ranking curves with respect to 3 domains: pain, PROMs, and ROM. RESULTS: A total of 35 studies comprising 3,643 shoulders (42% female, age 50 ± 5 years) were included. Arthroscopic decompression with acromioplasty ranked much greater than arthroscopic decompression alone for pain relief and PROM improvement, but the difference in absolute PROMs was not statistically significant. Corticosteroid injection (CSI) alone demonstrated inferior outcomes across all 3 domains (pain, PROMs, and ROM) with low cumulative rankings. Physical therapy (PT) with CSI demonstrated moderate-to-excellent clinical improvement across all 3 domains whereas PT alone demonstrated excellent ROM and low-moderate outcomes in pain and PROM domains. PT with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or alternative therapies ranked highly for PROM outcomes and moderate for pain and ROM domains. Finally, platelet-rich plasma injections demonstrated moderate outcomes for pain, forward flexion, and abduction with very low-ranking outcomes for PROMs and external rotation. CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic decompression with acromioplasty and PT demonstrated superior outcomes whereas CSI demonstrated poor outcomes in all 3 domains (pain, PROMs, and ROM). For patients with significant symptoms, the authors recommend PT with CSI as a first-line treatment, followed by acromioplasty and PT if conservative treatment fails. For patients with symptoms limited to 1 to 2 domains, the authors recommend a shared decision-making approach focusing on treatment rankings within domains pertinent to individual patient symptomatology.

It is performed to treat patients with suspected shoulder impingement syndrome, i.e., subacromial pain syndrome. Only few studies have specifically assessed return-to-work rates after subacromial decompression surgery. All existing evidence comes from open, unblinded study designs and this lack of blinding introduces the potential for bias. We assessed return to work and its predictors in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome in a secondary analysis of a placebo-surgery controlled trial. METHODS: One hundred eighty-four patients in a randomised trial had undergone arthroscopic subacromial decompression (n = 57), diagnostic arthroscopy, a placebo surgical intervention, (n = 59), or exercise therapy (n = 68). We assessed return to work, defined as having returned to work for at least two follow-up visits by the primary 24-month time point, work status at 24 and 60 months, and trajectories of return to work per follow-up time point. Patients and outcome assessors were blinded to the assignment regarding the arthroscopic subacromial decompression vs. diagnostic arthroscopy comparison. We assessed the treatment effect on the full analysis set as the difference between the groups in return-to-work rates and work status at 24 months and at 60 months using Chi-square test and the predictors of return to work with logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: There was no difference in the trajectories of return to work between the study groups. By 24 months, 50 of 57 patients (88%) had returned to work in the arthroscopic subacromial decompression group, while the respective figures were 52 of 59 (88%) in the diagnostic arthroscopy group and 61 of 68 (90%) in the exercise therapy group. No clinically relevant predictors of return to work were found. The proportion of patients at work was 80% (147/184) at 24 months and 73% (124/184) at 60 months, with no difference between the treatment groups (p-values 0.842 and 0.943, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic subacromial decompression provided no benefit over diagnostic arthroscopy or exercise therapy on return to work in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome. We did not find clinically relevant predictors of return to work either.

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of validated exergames played through a system using ""depth sensor"" and bespoke software against standard physiotherapy in patients treated with arthroscopic shoulder surgery. This included the following common conditions: subacromial impingement syndrome, calcific tendinopathy, and rotator cuff tear. METHODS: Following arthroscopic shoulder surgery, patients were randomized into 1 of 2 groups: In the standard rehabilitation group, patients were followed up for 12 weeks after surgery with standard postoperative physiotherapy and underwent electronic measurements of their active range of movement (ROM). In the exergame group, patients followed a postoperative regimen of exergames using the principles of gamification with physiotherapy support. Patients were given an exergame schedule prescribed by their therapist on Medical Interactive Recovery Assistant (MIRA) software (MIRA Rehab, London, UK) paired with a Microsoft Kinect sensor (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). The primary outcome was active ROM objectively measured by MIRA and Kinect. Secondary outcome measures included the Oxford Shoulder Score, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score, and the EQ-VAS score at 12 weeks after surgery. RESULTS: A total of 71 patients were recruited to the study. We excluded 7 patients based on intraoperative findings. Thirty-three patients were treated with exergames, and 31 patients underwent conventional physiotherapy. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in baseline ROM. Postoperatively, there was no significant difference in any of the cardinal planes of movement (forward flexion, P = .64; abduction, P = .33; and external rotation, P = .75). The mean Oxford Shoulder Score improved from 29.25 to 38.2 in the control group (P = .001) and from 27.1 to 35.1 in the trial group (P = .01); there was no significant difference between the groups at 12 weeks (P = .246). The mean Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score improved from 38.13 to 16.98 in the control group (P = .001) and from 42.3 to 22.54 in the trial group (P = .007); there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (P = .328). There was no significant difference in the EQ-VAS score in either group at any time point (P = .5866). CONCLUSION: This randomized controlled trial demonstrates that exergames can be used effectively in the rehabilitation of patients following arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Outcomes, judged by ROM and patient-reported outcome measures, are equivalent to conventional physiotherapy rehabilitation protocols.

Clinical decision-making regarding the best treatment option is often difficult. This study aims to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of treatment options for relieving pain and improving function in patients with SSCs. METHODS: Eight databases [including MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, PEDro, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry] were searched from inception until April 2020. Randomised clinical/controlled trials of adult patients investigating the effects of nonsurgical (e.g. corticosteroid injections, therapeutic exercise, shockwave therapy) and surgical treatment for SSCs, compared with each other, placebo, usual care or no treatment, were retrieved. Pairs of reviewers screened studies independently, quality appraised eligible studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, extracted and checked data for accuracy. Primary outcomes were pain and disability in the short term (⩽3 months) and long term (⩾6 months). Direct and indirect evidence of treatment effectiveness was synthesised using random-effects network meta-analysis. RESULTS: The review identified 177 eligible trials. Summary estimates (based on 99 trials providing suitable data, 6764 patients, 20 treatment options) showed small to moderate effects for several treatments, but no significant differences on pain or function between many active treatment comparisons. The primary analysis indicated that exercise and laser therapy may provide comparative benefit in terms of both pain and function at different follow-up time-points, with larger effects found for laser in the short term at 2-6 weeks, although direct evidence was provided by one trial only, and for exercise in the longer term [standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18, 0.59 at 3-6 months] compared with control. Sensitivity analyses excluding studies at increased risk of bias confirmed only the comparative effects of exercise as being robust for both pain and function up until 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: Current evidence shows small to moderate effect sizes for most treatment options for SSCs. Six treatments had a high probability of being most effective, in the short term, for pain and function [acupuncture, manual therapy, exercise, exercise plus manual therapy, laser therapy and Microcurrent (MENS) (TENS)], but with low certainty for most treatment options. After accounting for risk of bias, there is evidence of moderate certainty for the comparative effects of exercise on function in patients with SSCs. Future large, high-quality pragmatic randomised trials or meta-analyses are needed to better understand whether specific subgroups of patients respond better to some treatments than others.",conservative treatments; network meta-analysis; rotator cuff; shoulder impingement; subacromial; systematic review,"Primary Care Centre Versus Arthritis, School of Medicine, Keele University, Keele, Staffordshire, UK.",en,NA,NA

We aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a progressive exercise programme with a single session of best practice physiotherapy advice, with or without corticosteroid injection, in adults with a rotator cuff disorder. METHODS: In this pragmatic, multicentre, superiority, randomised controlled trial (2 × 2 factorial), we recruited patients from 20 UK National Health Service trusts. We included patients aged 18 years or older with a rotator cuff disorder (new episode within the past 6 months). Patients were excluded if they had a history of significant shoulder trauma (eg, dislocation, fracture, or full-thickness tear requiring surgery), neurological disease affecting the shoulder, other shoulder conditions (eg, inflammatory arthritis, frozen shoulder, or glenohumeral joint instability), received corticosteroid injection or physiotherapy for shoulder pain in the past 6 months, or were being considered for surgery. Patients were randomly assigned (centralised computer-generated system, 1:1:1:1) to progressive exercise (≤6 sessions), best practice advice (one session), corticosteroid injection then progressive exercise, or corticosteroid injection then best practice advice. The primary outcome was the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) score over 12 months, analysed on an intention-to-treat basis (statistical significance set at 1%). The trial was registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Register, ISRCTN16539266, and EuDRACT, 2016-002991-28. FINDINGS: Between March 10, 2017, and May 2, 2019, we screened 2287 patients. 708 patients were randomly assigned to progressive exercise (n=174), best practice advice (n=174), corticosteroid injection then progressive exercise (n=182), or corticosteroid injection then best practice advice (n=178). Over 12 months, SPADI data were available for 166 (95%) patients in the progressive exercise group, 164 (94%) in the best practice advice group, 177 (97%) in the corticosteroid injection then progressive exercise group, and 175 (98%) in the corticosteroid injection then best practice advice group. We found no evidence of a difference in SPADI score between progressive exercise and best practice advice when analysed over 12 months (adjusted mean difference -0·66 [99% CI -4·52 to 3·20]). We also found no evidence of a difference between corticosteroid injection compared with no injection when analysed over 12 months (-1·11 [-4·47 to 2·26]). No serious adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Progressive exercise was not superior to a best practice advice session with a physiotherapist in improving shoulder pain and function. Subacromial corticosteroid injection provided no long-term benefit in patients with rotator cuff disorders.

This leaves nonoperative care as the only treatment option, but recent studies suggest that the dose of strengthening exercise is not sufficient in current nonoperative care. At this point, it is unknown if adding more strengthening to current nonoperative care is of clinical value. PURPOSE: To assess the effectiveness of adding a large dose of shoulder strengthening to current nonoperative care for subacromial impingement compared with usual care alone. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: In this double-blinded, pragmatic randomized controlled trial, we randomly allocated 200 consecutive patients referred to orthopaedic shoulder specialist care for long-standing shoulder pain (>3 months), aged 18 to 65 years and diagnosed with subacromial impingement using validated criteria, to the intervention group (IG) or control group (CG). Outcome assessors were blinded, and participants were blinded to the study hypothesis as well as to the treatment method in the other group. The CG received usual nonoperative care; the IG underwent the same plus an add-on intervention designed to at least double the total dose of shoulder strengthening. The primary outcome was the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI; 0-100) at 4-month follow-up, with 10 points defined as the minimal clinically important difference. Secondary outcomes included shoulder strength, range of motion, health-related quality of life, and the Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS). RESULTS: Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses showed no significant or clinically relevant between-group differences for any outcome. From baseline to 4-month follow-up, SPADI scores improved in both groups (intention-to-treat analysis; IG, -22.1 points; CG, -22.7 points; between-group mean difference, 0.6 points [95% CI, -5.5 to 6.6]). At 4 months after randomization, only 54% of the IG and 48% of the CG (P = .4127) reached the PASS. No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: Adding a large dose of shoulder strengthening to current nonoperative care for patients with subacromial impingement did not result in superior shoulder-specific patient-reported outcomes. Moreover, approximately half of all randomized patients did not achieve the PASS after 4 months of nonoperative care, leaving many of these patients with unacceptable symptoms. This study showed that adding more exercise is not a viable solution to this problem.

In this paper, the development process and the resultant physiotherapist-led exercise programme used in the SPeEDy study is described. METHODS: Thirteen physiotherapists and three patients met to discuss and develop the key principles that should underpin the exercise programme. RESULTS: Taking in to account the current research evidence and incorporating expert clinical and patient opinion, the group developed an individualised, structured and progressive physiotherapist-led exercise programme based on the principle of self dosing. Exercise prescription within the programme is based on establishing the current functional capacity of the patient in relation to the most challenging shoulder movements and is supported over approximately six contact sessions across a 12-week period. CONCLUSION: The SPeEDy study aims to recruit 76 participants across eight hospitals and will provide high quality evidence about the feasibility of a future main randomised controlled trial in a clinical area where there is a lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials to support clinical decision-making.

RCD is a continuum ranging from tendinopathy to full-thickness tendon tear. Recent studies have shown that subacromial decompression and non-surgical treatments provide equivalent results in RCD without a full-thickness tendon lesion. However, the importance of surgery for full-thickness tendon tears remains unclear. METHODS: In a pragmatic, randomised, controlled trial, 417 patients with subacromial pain underwent 3-month initial rehabilitation and MRI arthrography (MRA) for the diagnosis of RCD. Of these, 190 shoulders remained symptomatic and were randomised to non-surgical or surgical treatments. The primary outcomes were the mean changes in the Visual Analogue Scale for pain and the Constant Murley Score for shoulder function at the 2-year follow-up. RESULTS: At the 2-year follow-up, both non-surgical and surgical treatments for RCD reduced pain and improved shoulder function. The scores differed between groups by 4 (95% CI -3 to 10, p=0.25) for pain and 3.4 (95% CI -0.4 to 7.1, p=0.077) for function. Among patients with full-thickness ruptures, the reduction in pain (13, 95% CI 5 to 22, p=0.002) and improvement in function (7.0, 95% CI 1.8 to 12.2, p=0.008) favoured surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Non-surgical and surgical treatments for RCD provided equivalent improvements in pain and function. Therefore, we recommend non-surgical treatment as the primary choice for patients with RCD. However, surgery yielded superior improvement in pain and function for full-thickness rotator cuff rupture. Therefore, rotator cuff repair may be suggested after failed non-surgical treatment.

METHODS: We conducted a multicentre, three group, randomised, controlled superiority trial. We included 210 patients aged 35-65 years, who had symptoms consistent with shoulder impingement syndrome for more than 3 months. 175 participants (83%) completed the 5 years follow-up. Patient enrolment began on 1 February 2005 and the 5-year follow-up was completed by 10 October 2018. The two primary outcomes were shoulder pain at rest and on arm activity measured with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Minimally important difference (MID) was set at 15. We used a mixed-model repeated measurements analysis of variance with participant as a random factor, the baseline value as a covariate and assuming a covariance structure with compound symmetry. RESULTS: In the primary intention to treat analysis (ASD vs diagnostic arthroscopy), there were no between-group differences that exceeded the MID for the primary outcomes at 5 years: the mean difference between groups (ASD minus diagnostic arthroscopy) in pain VAS were -2.0 (95% CI -8.5 to 4.6; p=0.56) at rest and -8.0 (-17.3 to 1.3; p=0.093) on arm activity. There were no between-group differences in the secondary outcomes or adverse events that exceeded the MID. In our secondary comparison (ASD vs exercise therapy), the mean differences between groups (ASD minus exercise therapy) in pain VAS were 1.0 (-5.6 to 7.6; p=0.77) at rest and -3.9 (-12.8 to 5.1; p=0.40) on arm activity.

The purpose of this study was to conduct an overview of SRs of RCTs to critically appraise the evidence and establish the current state of effectiveness of conservative versus surgical interventions on clinical outcomes among patients with shoulder impingement. Method: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PubMed electronic databases were searched for January 2008 to September 2018, and we found SRs of RCTs of patients with shoulder impingement, subacromial pain syndrome, or subacromial impingement syndrome who had received conservative versus surgical interventions to improve outcomes. Two authors extracted the data, and two independent review authors assessed the risk of bias and quality. Results: A total of 15 SRs were identified. One was rated as high quality, 7 as moderate quality, 5 as low quality, and 2 as critically low quality. The results were in line with one another, indicating that no differences in outcomes existed between conservative and surgical interventions among patients with shoulder impingement. Conclusion: There were no clinically important or statistically significant differences in outcomes between conservative versus surgical interventions among patients with subacromial impingement syndrome. To enhance clinical outcomes in this patient population, shoulder-specific exercises that aim to improve muscle strength and flexibility must be considered as the first line of conservative treatment.",conservative treatment; randomized controlled trials; surgery; systematic review,"Collaborative Program in Musculoskeletal Health Research, Bone and Joint Institute, Western University.",en,NA,NA

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a potential treatment after conservative treatments fail and prior to surgical intervention; however, it has not been tested in wheelchair users who have recalcitrant shoulder pain associated with rotator cuff disease. The objective of this pilot project was to test the safety and potential treatment effect of an ultrasound-guided PRP injection for shoulder pain in the aforementioned population.Design: Prospective, quasi-experimental.Setting: Clinical research center.Participants: Six wheelchair users with SCI (3 paraplegia, 3 tetraplegia) who had chronic shoulder pain due to rotator cuff disease (presence of anterior shoulder pain, positive physical examination tests for rotator cuff disease, and tendinopathy demonstrated by ultrasound) and failed at least six months of conservative treatment.Interventions: Ultrasound-guided PRP injection into pathological shoulder tendons, targeting the supraspinatus. Subjects were provided a standardized stretching and strengthening program and were followed for 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks post-intervention with outcomes collected at each time-point.Outcome Measures: Wheelchair User's Shoulder Pain Index (WUSPI); pain Numerical Rating Scale (NRS); physical and ultrasound examinations for supraspinatus tendinopathy; 5-point patient global impression of change (PGIC).Results: WUSPI (69.9%, P < 0.001), NRS (49.6%, P < 0.01), and physical exam scores (35.7%, P < 0.01) decreased 24 weeks after treatment. Participants reported overall improvement in their status as a result of the treatment. No adverse events were noted, and no changes in ultrasound markers for tendinopathy were observed.Conclusion: A single, ultrasound-guided PRP injection into the supraspinatus tendon, followed by a stretching and strengthening exercise program, was safe and provided improvements in shoulder pain outcome measures in this sample for 24 weeks.

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of SAA vs. placebo for pain relief after arthroscopic subacromial shoulder procedures. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for randomized controlled trials comparing SAA with placebo after arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Outcomes collected included pain scores (converted to equivalent ordinal visual analog scores; minimal clinically important difference 1.4 cm), oral morphine equivalents used postoperatively, and catheter-related complications. Meta-analysis was performed via a random-effects model. Included trials underwent a risk of bias and quality of evidence assessment. RESULTS: Nine studies involving 459 participants were included. There were no clinically significant changes for pain scores in SAA at 6-, 12-, 24-, and 48-hour postoperative timepoints. Patients receiving SAA used less morphine equivalents of pain medication at 12 hours only (-0.37 mg, 95% confidence interval: -0.63 to -0.11), but there was no significant difference at 24 and 48 hours. There were no major complications (infection or reoperation). Included trials demonstrated a moderate risk-of-bias, and low to very low quality of evidence for primary outcomes.

Though this disorder has been known for a long time, it remains a poorly understood entity. Over the years several hypotheses have been put forward to describe the pathogenesis of SAIS but no clear explanation has been found. Two mechanisms, the extrinsic and intrinsic mechanism, have been described for the impingement syndrome. The intrinsic mechanism theories which deny the existence of impingement are gaining popularity in recent years. The various shoulder tests used to diagnose SAIS have low specificity with an average of about 50%. Meta-analysis shows that neither the Neer sign nor the Hawkins sign has diagnostic utility for impingement syndrome. Several randomised controlled trials have shown that the outcome of treatment of SAIS by surgery is no better than conservative treatment. Physiotherapy alone can provide good outcome which is comparable to that achieved with surgery without the costs and complications associated with surgery. Since decompression with surgery does not provide any additional benefits as compared to conservative treatment for patients with SAIS, the impingement theory has become antiquated and surgical treatment should have no role in the treatment of such patients. There are calls by some practitioners to abandon the term impingement syndrome and rename it as anterolateral shoulder pain syndrome. It appears that SAIS is a medical myth. There are others who called SAIS as a clinical illusion.",acromioplasty; medical myth; subacromial decompression; subacromial impingement syndrome,"Department of Orthopaedics, KPJ Selangor Specialist Hospital, Shah Alam, Malaysia.",en,Review,NA

OBJECTIVES: To synthesise the available evidence regarding the benefits and harms of rotator cuff repair with or without subacromial decompression in the treatment of rotator cuff tears of the shoulder. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov and WHO ICRTP registry unrestricted by date or language until 8 January 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including adults with full-thickness rotator cuff tears and assessing the effect of rotator cuff repair compared to placebo, no treatment, or any other treatment were included. As there were no trials comparing surgery with placebo, the primary comparison was rotator cuff repair with or without subacromial decompression versus non-operative treatment (exercises with or without glucocorticoid injection). Other comparisons were rotator cuff repair and acromioplasty versus rotator cuff repair alone, and rotator cuff repair and subacromial decompression versus subacromial decompression alone. Major outcomes were mean pain, shoulder function, quality of life, participant-rated global assessment of treatment success, adverse events and serious adverse events. The primary endpoint for this review was one year. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodologic procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine trials with 1007 participants. Three trials compared rotator cuff repair with subacromial decompression followed by exercises with exercise alone. These trials included 339 participants with full-thickness rotator cuff tears diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound examination. One of the three trials also provided up to three glucocorticoid injections in the exercise group. All surgery groups received tendon repair with subacromial decompression and the postoperative exercises were similar to the exercises provided for the non-operative groups. Five trials (526 participants) compared repair with acromioplasty versus repair alone; and one trial (142 participants) compared repair with subacromial decompression versus subacromial decompression alone. The mean age of trial participants ranged between 56 and 68 years, and females comprised 29% to 56% of the participants. Symptom duration varied from a mean of 10 months up to 28 months. Two trials excluded tears with traumatic onset of symptoms. One trial defined a minimum duration of symptoms of six months and required a trial of conservative therapy before inclusion. The trials included mainly repairable full-thickness supraspinatus tears, six trials specifically excluded tears involving the subscapularis tendon. All trials were at risk of bias for several criteria, most notably due to lack of participant and personnel blinding, but also for other reasons such as unclearly reported methods of random sequence generation or allocation concealment (six trials), incomplete outcome data (three trials), selective reporting (six trials), and other biases (six trials). Our main comparison was subacromial decompression versus non-operative treatment and results are reported for the 12 month follow up. At one year, moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias) from 3 trials with 258 participants indicates that surgery probably provides little or no improvement in pain; mean pain (range 0 to 10, higher scores indicate more pain) was 1.6 points with non-operative treatment and 0.87 points better (0.43 better to 1.30 better) with surgery.. Mean function (zero to 100, higher score indicating better outcome) was 72 points with non-operative treatment and 6 points better (2.43 better to 9.54 better) with surgery (3 trials; 269 participants), low-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision). Participant-rated global success rate was 873/1000 after non-operative treatment and 943/1000 after surgery corresponding to (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.22; low-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision). Health-related quality of life was 57.5 points (SF-36 mental component score, 0 to 100, higher score indicating better quality of life) with non-operative treatment and 1.3 points worse (4.5 worse to 1.9 better) with surgery (1 trial; 103 participants), low-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision). We were unable to estimate the risk of adverse events and serious adverse events as only one event was reported across the trials (very low-certainty evidence; downgraded once due to bias and twice due to very serious imprecision). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: At the moment, we are uncertain whether rotator cuff repair surgery provides clinically meaningful benefits to people with symptomatic tears; it may provide little or no clinically important benefits with respect to pain, function, overall quality of life or participant-rated global assessment of treatment success when compared with non-operative treatment. Surgery may not improve shoulder pain or function compared with exercises, with or without glucocorticoid injections. The trials included have methodology concerns and none included a placebo control. They included participants with mostly small degenerative tears involving the supraspinatus tendon and the conclusions of this review may not be applicable to traumatic tears, large tears involving the subscapularis tendon or young people. Furthermore, the trials did not assess if surgery could prevent arthritic changes in long-term follow-up. Further well-designed trials in this area that include a placebo-surgery control group and long follow-up are needed to further increase certainty about the effects of surgery for rotator cuff tears.",NA,"Monash University, Monash Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Cabrini Institute and Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Melbourne, Australia.",en,Review,NA

In this study, we examined its effect on pain and function following arthroscopic subacromial arthroscopic decompression (ASAD). METHODOLOGY: A prospective, randomized, and single-blinded design was used (13/LO0427) to compare the effect of a single postprocedure subacromial instillation of 10 ml hyaluronan, against 10 ml saline control. All patients had interscalene block along with general anesthesia and followed standard postoperative rehabilitation protocol. A power calculation for a 6-point difference in Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) indicated a minimum sample size of 44. Participants were assessed preoperatively, and at 12 weeks using the following outcome measures -Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), visual analog score (VAS), European quality of life score (EUROQOL), and Disability of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) scores. RESULTS: 46 patients were included for analysis. Both groups showed a mean improvement in OSS of 9 points (P = 0.0001), DASH (10 points, P < 0.05), and EUROQOL (0.13, P < 0.05). No significant difference was observed between groups in any of the recorded outcomes. Apart from one case of frozen shoulder in each group, no other complications were noted. CONCLUSION: While both groups showed improved pain and function scores after ASAD, no significant difference was seen between groups receiving placebo or hyaluronan. The intervention is safe but, in this study, has not been shown to improve postoperative pain or function over ASAD alone.

DESIGN: Longitudinal observational study using Hospital Episode Statistics linked to Payment by Results tariffs in England, 2007/2008 to 2016/2017. SETTING: Hospital care in England; Finland; New York State, USA; Florida State, USA and Western Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with subacromial shoulder pain. INTERVENTIONS: Subacromial decompression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: National procedure rates, costs and variation between clinical commissioning groups in England. RESULTS: Without robust clinical evidence, the use of subacromial decompression in England increased by 91% from 15 112 procedures (30 per 100 000 population) in 2007/2008, to 28 802 procedures (52 per 100 000 population) in 2016/2017, costing over £125 million per year. Rates of use of subacromial decompression are even higher internationally: Finland (131 per 100 000 in 2011), Florida State (130 per 100 000 in 2007), Western Australia (115 per 100 000 in 2013) and New York State (102 per 100 000 in 2006). Two randomised placebo-controlled trials have recently (2018) shown the procedure to be no more effective than placebo or conservative approaches. Health systems appear unable to avoid the rapid widespread use of procedures of unknown effectiveness, and methods for ceasing ineffective treatments are under-developed. CONCLUSIONS: Without good evidence, nearly 30 000 subacromial decompression procedures have been commissioned each year in England, costing over £1 billion since 2007/2008. Even higher rates of procedures are carried out in countries with less regulated health systems. High quality randomised trials need to be initiated before widespread adoption of promising operative procedures to avoid overtreatment and wasted resources, and methods to prevent or desist the use of ineffective procedures need to be expedited.",England; Subacromial decompression; arthroscopy; commissioning; shoulder surgery,"Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.",en,Research Article,NA

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients were randomly divided into two equal groups. The first group was assigned KT plus home exercise program (HEP) for 15 days. The second group was given 15 sessions of PT and HEP. Patients were assessed using active joint range of motion (ROM), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS; rest, movement, and night pain), the Society of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Evaluation (ASESS-100), Constant-Murley (C-M) scale, and Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) index at before and after treatment and at the end of the study (first month control visit). RESULTS: Physical therapy was found to be more effective than KT when these two treatment modalities were assessed based on ASESS-100, WORC index values, night pain, and movement pain. PT and KT treatments have similar effects in active ROM, rest pain, and C-M scale. At the end of the study, they were found to have similar effects except the night pain value. PT was found to be more effective for night pain than KT. CONCLUSION: Physical therapy was concluded to be more effective after treatment. The application of KT does not appear to be an alternative treatment method for SIS, but it can provide a potential supportive care for SIS.

Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of surgical intervention in comparison with nonoperative or sham treatments in patients with shoulder impingement in terms of both pain and functional outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Two reviewers independently screened MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed and Cochrane databases for randomized controlled trials published from 1946 to July 19, 2018. A risk-of-bias assessment was conducted for all included studies, and outcomes were pooled using a random effects model. The primary outcome was improvement in pain up to 2 years. Secondary outcomes were functional outcome scores reported in the short term (≤ 1 yr) and long term (≥ 2 yr). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I (2) statistic. Functional outcome scores were presented along with minimal clinically important differences to provide clinical context for findings. RESULTS: Thirteen randomized controlled trials (n = 1062 patients) were included in this review. Eligible patients had a mean age of 48 (standard deviation ± 4) years and 45% were men. The pooled treatment effect of surgical intervention for shoulder impingement did not demonstrate any benefit to surgery with respect to pain relief (mean difference -0.07, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.26) or short-term functional outcomes (standardized mean difference -0.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.27 to 0.08). Surgical intervention did result in a small statistically significant but clinically unimportant improvement in long-term functional outcomes (standardized mean difference 0.23, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.41).

It is often associated with lack of range of motion and reduced shoulder function. Lack of sleep and difficulties in performing basic daily life activities are common findings. Subacromial Impingement Syndrome (SAIS) has been considered as the most common cause of shoulder pain since it was described in 1852. Charles Neer, in 1972, described the presence of a ""proliferative spur and ridge"" on the undersurface of the acromion, which needs to be removed to improve the symptoms (acromioplasty). Neer's ""impingement"" hegemony was undisputed for at least 30 years. A more extensive knowledge of the pathogenesis of SAIS, however, has led authors to challenge the role of ""impingement"" in the shoulder pain and the role of surgical intervention. The aim of this review was to understand if there is still a role for surgical decompression in patients with SAIS. A literature review was performed in PubMed, PEDro, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using impingement, subacromial space, rotator cuff tears, tendinopathy, and tendinitis as key words. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with long-term follow-up comparing surgical intervention and conservative treatments in SAIS were preferred; however, prospective articles studying the outcome of surgical decompression and physiotherapy were also included. The majority of the studies showed no difference in the outcome between patients randomized to surgical decompression or conservative management. However, some studies reported better results after surgery, especially in the long term. Interpretation of the results is very difficult as most of the studies are of poor quality and have short follow-up. In our opinion, the type of subacromial lesion needs to be considered; this may offer an explanation to the difference in severity of symptoms and to the varying degrees of response to certain treatments, including surgery. Further studies are mandatory to better understand the role of surgery in SAIS.",bursitis; impingement; rotator cuff; rotator cuff tears; supraspinatus tendon; tendinitis; tendinopathy,"The Reading Shoulder Unit, Berkshire Independent Hospital Coley Park, Swallows Croft, Reading, Berkshire, UK, paoloconsigliere@gmail.com.",en,Review,NA

Differentially diagnosing partial tears of the rotator cuff tendons is difficult despite use of imaging and clinical examination. Our objective was to determine if a clinical assessment framework could discriminate between patients with partial and full thickness tears.Materials and Methods: Pre-operative baseline data from two randomized controlled trials of 452 adult patients awaiting rotator cuff repair were analyzed in this secondary analysis. Nineteen items from a pre-defined clinical assessment framework were investigated for association with the outcome of surgically confirmed partial or full thickness tear. Logistic regression tested independent associations and multivariable models were developed to create the most parsimonious model.Results: Thirty-two participants (7%) had partial thickness tears. Constant Power Score was the sole item associated with partial thickness tears (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.12). Traumatic mechanism of injury trended toward significance (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.06-4.48).Conclusions: Greater abduction strength (i.e., Constant Power Score) was associated with partial thickness tears. Other clinical assessment items did not differentiate between partial and full tears. Our results add to the growing body of research showing most clinical findings are not associated with a diagnosis in rotator cuff disease.Implications for RehabilitationGreater shoulder abduction strength (as measured with the Constant Power Score) was associated with partial thickness rotator cuff tears.Most findings within our clinical assessment framework did not distinguish between partial thickness and full thickness rotator cuff tears and thus, did not contribute to a differential pathoanatomical diagnosis.Since structural integrity of the rotator cuff and patient presentation show poor association, and rehabilitation intervention is often impairment-based, pathoanatomical diagnosis may not adequately direct non-surgical treatment. Including movement-based diagnoses or treatment classification systems in evaluation of rotator cuff disease may improve selection of appropriate conservative treatment.",Shoulder; clinical examination; diagnosis; rehabilitation; rotator cuff disease,"Department of Physical Therapy, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.",en,Research Article,NA

OBJECTIVES: To synthesise the available evidence of the benefits and harms of subacromial decompression surgery compared with placebo, no intervention or non-surgical interventions in people with rotator cuff disease (excluding full thickness rotator cuff tears). SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov and WHO ICRTP registry from 2006 until 22 October 2018, unrestricted by language. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with rotator cuff disease (excluding full-thickness tears), that compared subacromial decompression surgery with placebo, no treatment, or any other non-surgical interventions. As it is least prone to bias, subacromial decompression compared with placebo was the primary comparison. Other comparisons were subacromial decompression versus exercises or non-operative treatment. Major outcomes were mean pain scores, shoulder function, quality of life, participant global assessment of success, adverse events and serious adverse events. The primary endpoint for this review was one year. For serious adverse events, we also included data from prospective cohort studies designed to record harms that evaluated subacromial decompression surgery or shoulder arthroscopy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodologic procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight trials, with a total of 1062 randomised participants with rotator cuff disease, all with subacromial impingement. Two trials (506 participants) compared arthroscopic subacromial decompression with arthroscopy only (placebo surgery), with all groups receiving postoperative exercises. These trials included a third treatment group: no treatment (active monitoring) in one and exercises in the other. Six trials (556 participants) compared arthroscopic subacromial decompression followed by exercises with exercises alone. Two of these trials included a third arm: sham laser in one and open subacromial decompression in the other.Trial size varied from 42 to 313 participants. Participant mean age ranged between 42 and 65 years. Only two trials reported mean symptom duration (18 to 22 months in one trial and 30 to 31 months in the other), two did not report duration and four reported it categorically.Both placebo-controlled trials were at low risk of bias for the comparison of surgery versus placebo surgery. The other trials were at high risk of bias for several criteria, most notably at risk of performance or detection bias due to lack of participant and personnel blinding. We have restricted the reporting of results of benefits in the Abstract to the placebo-controlled trials.Compared with placebo, high-certainty evidence indicates that subacromial decompression provides no improvement in pain, shoulder function, or health-related quality of life up to one year, and probably no improvement in global success (moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded due to imprecision).At one year, mean pain (on a scale zero to 10, higher scores indicate more pain), was 2.9 points after placebo surgery and 0.26 better (0.84 better to 0.33 worse), after subacromial decompression (284 participants), an absolute difference of 3% (8% better to 3% worse), and relative difference of 4% (12% better to 5% worse). At one year, mean function (on a scale 0 to 100, higher score indicating better outcome), was 69 points after placebo surgery and 2.8 better (1.4 worse to 6.9 better), after surgery (274 participants), an absolute difference of 3% (7% better to 1% worse), and relative difference of 9% (22% better to 4% worse). Global success rate was 97/148 (or 655 per 1000), after placebo and 101/142 (or 708 per 1000) after surgery corresponding to RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.27). Health-related quality of life was 0.73 units (European Quality of Life EQ-5D, -0.59 to 1, higher score indicating better quality of life), after placebo and 0.03 units worse (0.011 units worse to 0.06 units better), after subacromial decompression (285 participants), an absolute difference of 1.3% (5% worse to 2.5% better), and relative difference of 4% (15% worse to 7% better).Adverse events including frozen shoulder or transient minor complications of surgery were reported in approximately 3% of participants across treatment groups in two randomised controlled trials, but due to low event rates we are uncertain if the risks differ between groups: 5/165 (37 per 1000) reported adverse events with subacromial decompression and 9/241 (34 per 1000) with placebo or non-operative treatment, RR 0.91 (95% CI 0.31 to 2.65) (moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded due to imprecision). The trials did not report serious adverse events.Based upon moderate-certainty evidence from two observational trials from the same prospective surgery registry, which also included other shoulder arthroscopic procedures (downgraded for indirectness), the incidence proportion of serious adverse events within 30 days following surgery was 0.5% (0.4% to 0.7%; data collected 2006 to 2011), or 0.6% (0.5 % to 0.7%; data collected 2011 to 2013). Serious adverse events such as deep infection, pulmonary embolism, nerve injury, and death have been observed in participants following shoulder surgery. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The data in this review do not support the use of subacromial decompression in the treatment of rotator cuff disease manifest as painful shoulder impingement. High-certainty evidence shows that subacromial decompression does not provide clinically important benefits over placebo in pain, function or health-related quality of life. Including results from open-label trials (with high risk of bias) did not change the estimates considerably. Due to imprecision, we downgraded the certainty of the evidence to moderate for global assessment of treatment success; there was probably no clinically important benefit in this outcome either compared with placebo, exercises or non-operative treatment.Adverse event rates were low, 3% or less across treatment groups in the trials, which is consistent with adverse event rates reported in the two observational studies. Although precise estimates are unknown, the risk of serious adverse events is likely less than 1%.",NA,"Monash Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Cabrini Institute and Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia, 3144.",en,Review,NA

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The use of resources, costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were assessed in the trial at six months and one year. Results were extrapolated to two years after randomization. Differences between treatment arms, based on the intention-to-treat principle, were adjusted for covariates and missing data were handled using multiple imputation. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated, with uncertainty around the values estimated using bootstrapping. RESULTS: Cumulative mean QALYs/mean costs of health care service use and surgery per patient from baseline to 12 months were estimated as 0.640 (standard error (se) 0.024)/£3147 (se 166) in the decompression arm, 0.656 (se 0.020)/£2830 (se 183) in the arthroscopy only arm and 0.522 (se 0.029)/£1451 (se 151) in the no treatment arm. Statistically significant differences in cumulative QALYs and costs were found at six and 12 months for the decompression versus no treatment comparison only. The probabilities of decompression being cost-effective compared with no treatment at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000 per QALY were close to 0% at six months and approximately 50% at one year, with this probability potentially increasing for the extrapolation to two years. DISCUSSION: The evidence for cost-effectiveness at 12 months was inconclusive. Decompression could be cost-effective in the longer-term, but results of this analysis are sensitive to the assumptions made about how costs and QALYs are extrapolated beyond the follow-up of the trial.",Cost-effectiveness analysis; Health economics; Placebo surgery; Quality-adjusted life years; Shoulder impingement; Subacromial decompression,"University of Oxford, Health Economics Research Centre, Nuffield Department of Population Health, Oxford, UK.",en,NA,NA

DESIGN: Multicentre, three group, randomised, double blind, sham controlled trial. SETTING: Orthopaedic departments at three public hospitals in Finland. PARTICIPANTS: 210 patients with symptoms consistent with shoulder impingement syndrome, enrolled from 1 February 2005 with two year follow-up completed by 25 June 2015. INTERVENTIONS: ASD, diagnostic arthroscopy (placebo control), and exercise therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Shoulder pain at rest and on arm activity (visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 to 100, with 0 denoting no pain), at 24 months. The threshold for minimal clinically important difference was set at 15. RESULTS: In the primary intention to treat analysis (ASD versus diagnostic arthroscopy), no clinically relevant between group differences were seen in the two primary outcomes at 24 months (mean change for ASD 36.0 at rest and 55.4 on activity; for diagnostic arthroscopy 31.4 at rest and 47.5 on activity). The observed mean difference between groups (ASD minus diagnostic arthroscopy) in pain VAS were -4.6 (95% confidence interval -11.3 to 2.1) points (P=0.18) at rest and -9.0 (-18.1 to 0.2) points (P=0.054) on arm activity. No between group differences were seen between the ASD and diagnostic arthroscopy groups in the secondary outcomes or adverse events. In the secondary comparison (ASD versus exercise therapy), statistically significant differences were found in favour of ASD in the two primary outcomes at 24 months in both VAS at rest (-7.5, -14.0 to -1.0, points; P=0.023) and VAS on arm activity (-12.0, -20.9 to -3.2, points; P=0.008), but the mean differences between groups did not exceed the pre-specified minimal clinically important difference. Of note, this ASD versus exercise therapy comparison is not only confounded by lack of blinding but also likely to be biased in favour of ASD owing to the selective removal of patients with likely poor outcome from the ASD group, without comparable exclusions from the exercise therapy group. CONCLUSIONS: In this controlled trial involving patients with a shoulder impingement syndrome, arthroscopic subacromial decompression provided no benefit over diagnostic arthroscopy at 24 months.

It is usually due to a defect of the rotator cuff and/or an impingement syndrome. METHODS: This review is based on pertinent literature retrieved by a selective search of the Medline database. RESULTS: Patients with shoulder impingement syndrome suffer from painful entrapment of soft tissue whenever they elevate the arm. The pathological mechanism is a structural narrowing in the subacromial space. A multiplicity of potential etiologies makes the diagnosis more difficult; it is established by the history and physical examination and can be confirmed with x-ray, ultra - sonography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The initial treatment is conservative, e.g., with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, infiltrations, and patient exercises. Conservative treatment yields satisfactory results within 2 years in 60% of cases. If symptoms persist, decompressive surgery is performed as long as the continuity of the rotator cuff is preserved and there is a pathological abnormality of the bursa. The correct etiologic diagnosis and choice of treatment are essential for a good outcome. The formal evidence level regarding the best treatment strategy is low, and it has not yet been determined whether surgical or conservative treatment is better.

METHODS: A literature search was performed, in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, to identify level I and II studies comparing operative versus nonoperative treatment of rotator cuff tears. Two independent researchers reviewed a total of 1013 articles. Three studies qualified for inclusion. These included 269 patients with 1-year follow-up. The mean age ranged from 59 to 65 years. Clinical outcome measures included the Constant score and visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain.

Evidence suggests that structured physiotherapy may be as effective as surgery in this condition with significant improvements demonstrated in trials involving scapular retraining, rotator cuff strengthening and flexibility exercises. Most published programs typically utilise isotonic concentric and/or eccentric strengthening modes. Recently, immediate analgesic effects and muscle strength gains following heavy-load isometric exercises in lower limb tendinopathy conditions have been observed. It is pertinent to ascertain whether such outcomes can be replicated in SPS/rotator cuff tendinopathy. The primary aim of this study is to establish the feasibility of undertaking a full-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) that compares the effects of isometric, isotonic concentric and isotonic eccentric rotator cuff contractions when used as part of a semi-standardised exercise-based physiotherapy program in patients diagnosed with SPS. The secondary aim is to explore potential trends or treatment effects of the exercise intervention. METHODS: Thirty-six participants diagnosed with SPS will be randomised to one of three intervention groups and undergo a one-on-one exercise-based physiotherapy intervention, involving scapular and rotator cuff muscle retraining and strengthening. Each group will utilise a different mode of rotator cuff strengthening-isometric, isotonic concentric or isotonic eccentric. Rotator cuff tendon responses to isometric loading are not yet established in the literature; hence, individualised, progressive loading will be used in this pilot study in accordance with symptoms. The intervention will involve two phases: during Phase 1 (weeks 1-6) participants undertake the active group-specific physiotherapy treatment; in Phase 2 (weeks 6-12), they undertake a progressive, but no longer group-specific exercise program. To determine feasibility, an evaluation of key study parameters including (a) ease of recruitment (rate and number as well as suitability of the assessment algorithm), (b) adherence to all phases of the exercise intervention including home program compliance and logbook completion, (c) participant non-completion (drop out number and rate) and (d) adverse events (nature and number) will be undertaken. Secondary outcomes will measure immediate effects: (i) within-treatment changes in pain perception (verbal rating scale (VRS) and shoulder muscle strength (hand-held dynamometer) as well as longer-term changes: (ii) shoulder-related symptoms and disability (Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC) and Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI)), (iii) perception of pain (11-point numerical rating scale (NRS), (iv) shoulder muscle strength (hand-held dynamometer) and (v) perceived global rating of change score. The immediate within-treatment assessment of pain and muscle strength will be undertaken in treatments 2 and 3, and the longer term measures will be collected at the primary (conclusion of Phase 1 at 6 weeks) and secondary (conclusion of Phase 2 at 12 weeks) end-points of the study.

Health systems are calling for greater evidence of economic impacts of particular healthcare services. Telerehabilitation programmes have the potential to reduce costs and improve patient access as an alternative to traditional care. Cost analysis has been traditionally included in study protocols and results, although the reliability and research methodology have frequently been under debate. The aim of this study was to compare costs related to a telerehabilitation programme versus conventional physiotherapy following subacromial decompression surgery (ASD). Methods The study was embedded in a randomised controlled trial. The economic analysis was based on the perspective of the health sector and the human capital method. Only the costs associated with the provision of physiotherapy services were taken into account. Costs were measured during the intervention period between baseline and 12 weeks for both groups. Student's t-test was used to compare independent variables between the two groups, with a 95% confidence interval for the estimates and real costs. Results The estimated total cost analysis shows a preliminary cost differential in favour of the telerehabilitation group, meaning that for each participant's total intervention, telerehabilitation saves 29.8% of the costs. Real cost analysis, only for received treatments, shows a cost differential in favour of telerehabilitation, meaning that for each participant's total intervention, telerehabilitation saves 22.15% of the costs incurred for conventional rehabilitation. Conclusions Our study provides direct and meaningful information about telerehabilitation opportunities and can be an essential component in further cost evaluations for different strategies after surgical procedures. This study demonstrates that there was a trend towards lower healthcare costs after ASD.

We have now investigated whether this result was maintained after 5 years and compared the outcomes of surgery and non-surgical treatment. Patients and methods - 97 patients were included in the previously reported randomized study of patients on a waiting list for surgery. These patients were randomized to specific or unspecific exercises. After 3 months of exercises the patients were asked if they still wanted surgery and this was also assessed at the present 5-year follow-up. The 1-year assessment included Constant-Murley score, DASH, VAS at night, rest and activity, EQ-5D, and EQ-VAS. All these outcome assessments were repeated after 5 years in 91 of the patients. Results - At the 5-year follow-up more patients in the specific exercise group had declined surgery, 33 of 47 as compared with 16 of 44 (p = 0.001) in the unspecific exercise group. The mean Constant-Murley score continued to improve between the 1- and 5-year follow-ups in both surgically and non-surgically treated groups. On a group level there was no clinically relevant change between 1 and 5 years in any of the other outcome measures regardless of treatment. Interpretation - This 5-year follow-up of a previously published randomized controlled trial found that specific exercises reduced the need for surgery in patients with subacromial pain. Patients not responding to specific exercises may achieve similar good results with surgery. These findings emphasize that a specific exercise program may serve as a selection tool for surgery.",NA,"a Institution for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Division of Orthopaedics , Linköping University.",en,NA,NA

The rationale for the surgery rests on the tenet that symptom relief is achieved through decompression of the rotator cuff tendon passage. The primary objective of this superiority trial is to compare the efficacy of ASD versus diagnostic arthroscopy (DA) in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS), where DA differs only by the lack of subacromial decompression. A third group of supervised progressive exercise therapy (ET) will allow for pragmatic assessment of the relative benefits of surgical versus non-operative treatment strategies. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Finnish Subacromial Impingement Arthroscopy Controlled Trial is an ongoing multicentre, three-group randomised controlled study. We performed two-fold concealed allocation, first by randomising patients to surgical (ASD or DA) or conservative (ET) treatment in 2:1 ratio and then those allocated to surgery further to ASD or DA in 1:1 ratio. Our two primary outcomes are pain at rest and at arm activity, assessed using visual analogue scale (VAS). We will quantify the treatment effect as the difference between the groups in the change in the VAS scales with the associated 95% CI at 24 months. Our secondary outcomes are functional assessment (Constant score and Simple shoulder test), quality of life (15D and SF-36), patient satisfaction, proportions of responders and non-responders, reoperations/treatment conversions, all at 2 years post-randomisation, as well as adverse effects and complications. We recruited a total of 210 patients from three tertiary referral centres. We will conduct the primary analysis on the intention-to-treat basis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Pirkanmaa Hospital District and duly registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. The findings of this study will be disseminated widely through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.

Rejecting the mechanistic theory has also led to abandoning operative treatment at initial presentation in the first line. Physiotherapy exercise programmes are the accepted first line treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term additional benefits of subacromial decompression in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomised controlled trial of 140 patients (52 men, 88 women, mean age 47.1 years; 18 to 60) with rotator cuff tendinopathy extended previous work up to a maximum of 13 years. The patients were randomised into two treatment groups: arthroscopic acromioplasty and a supervised exercise treatment and a similar supervised exercise treatment alone. Self-reported pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS) was the primary outcome measure. Secondary measures were disability, working ability, pain at night, Shoulder Disability Questionnaire score and the number of painful days during the three months preceding the final assessment. RESULTS: A total of 90 patients (64%) returned questionnaires at a mean 12 years after randomisation. On an intention-to-treat basis, both treatment groups reached statistically significant improvement compared with the initial VAS for pain, but there was no significant difference between groups. The same was true in the secondary outcome measures. Due to group changes, the results were also analysed per protocol: operated or not. No significant differences between the groups were found. CONCLUSION: The natural history of rotator cuff tendinopathy probably plays a significant role in the results in the long-term. Even though the patients who underwent operative treatment had a stronger belief in recovery, which is likely to be surgical and the effect of placebo, the exercise group obtained similar results. In the future, an optimum exercise regime should be searched for, as the most clinically and cost-effective conservative treatment for rotator cuff tendinopathy.

METHODS: The review was conducted from March 2016 to November 2016 in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), and was registered with PROSPERO. Eligibility criteria included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews, or meta-analyses studying adult patients with a shoulder diagnosis. Interventions qualified if they did not involve prescription medication or surgical procedures, although these could be used in the comparison group or groups. At least 2 independent reviewers assessed the quality of each study using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network checklists. Shoulder conditions addressed were shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS), rotator cuff-associated disorders (RCs), adhesive capsulitis (AC), and nonspecific shoulder pain. RESULTS: Twenty-five systematic reviews and 44 RCTs met inclusion criteria. Low- to moderate-quality evidence supported the use of manual therapies for all 4 shoulder conditions. Exercise, particularly combined with physical therapy protocols, was beneficial for SIS and AC. For SIS, moderate evidence supported several passive modalities. For RC, physical therapy protocols were found beneficial but not superior to surgery in the long term. Moderate evidence supported extracorporeal shockwave therapy for calcific tendinitis RC. Low-level laser was the only modality for which there was moderate evidence supporting its use for all 4 conditions. CONCLUSION: The findings of this literature review may help inform practitioners who use conservative methods (eg, doctors of chiropractic, physical therapists, and other manual therapists) regarding the levels of evidence for modalities used for common shoulder conditions.",Chiropractic; Conservative Treatment; Manual Therapy; Shoulder; Spinal Manipulation,"University of Western States, Portland, OR.",en,Review,NA

This study aimed to determine the long-term clinical and radiologic treatment effect of arthroscopic acromioplasty in patients with chronic SAPS. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized clinical trial, 56 patients with chronic SAPS (median age, 47 years; age range, 31-60 years) were randomly allocated to arthroscopic bursectomy alone or to bursectomy combined with acromioplasty and were followed up for a median of 12 years. The primary outcome was the Constant score. Secondary outcomes included the Simple Shoulder Test, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, VAS for shoulder functionality, and rotator cuff integrity assessed with magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound. RESULTS: A total of 43 patients (77%) were examined at a median of 12 years' follow-up. Intention-to-treat analysis at 12 years' follow-up did not show a significant additional treatment effect of acromioplasty on bursectomy alone in improvement in Constant score (5 points; 95% confidence interval, -5.1 to 15.6), Simple Shoulder Test score, VAS score for pain, or VAS score for shoulder function. The prevalence of rotator cuff tears was not significantly different between the bursectomy group (17%) and acromioplasty group (10%). CONCLUSIONS: There were no relevant additional effects of arthroscopic acromioplasty on bursectomy alone with respect to clinical outcomes and rotator cuff integrity at 12 years' follow-up. These findings bring the effectiveness of acromioplasty into question and may support the idea of a more conservative approach in the initial treatment of SAPS.",Rotator cuff; arthroscopy; bursitis; pain; shoulder; shoulder impingement syndrome; surgery,"Department of Orthopaedics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.",en,NA,NA

Physiotherapy with exercises is generally recommended to restore function after surgery in patients with chronic subacromial syndrome. Relatively few studies have investigated the feasibility of telerehabilitation interventions in musculoskeletal and orthopaedic disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a customizable telerehabilitation intervention and compare with traditional care. Methods This research includes 18 consecutive patients with subacromial impingement who underwent arthroscopic subacromial decompression in a controlled clinical prospective study. Patients were randomized to either a 12-week telerehabilitation programme or the usual face-to-face physical therapy for immediate postoperative rehabilitation. We have developed a telerehabilitation system to provide services to patients who have undergone shoulder arthroscopy. An independent blinded observer performed postoperative follow-up after 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Results The preliminary efficacy of this telerehabilitation programme in terms of both physical and functional objective outcome measures was assessed on eight patients. Using the Constant-Murley score to evaluate functional outcome, patients in the telerehabilitation group were shown to have improved from a mean 43.50 ± 3.21 points to a mean 68.50 ± 0.86 points after 12 weeks. The physical and functional improvements in the telerehabilitation group were similar to those in the control group ( p = 0.213). There was a non-significant trend for greater improvements in the telerehabilitation group for most outcome measurements. Conclusion The results of this study provide evidence for the efficacy of telerehabilitation after shoulder arthroscopy in shoulder impingement syndrome. A telerehabilitation programme with range of motion, strengthening of the rotator cuff and scapula stabilizers exercises seems to be similar and not inferior to traditional face-to-face physiotherapy after subacromial arthroscopic decompression. Through this study, we are developing our preliminary dataset to evaluate the efficacy of telerehabilitation programmes following surgical procedures in musculoskeletal injuries and for comparison with more traditional interventions.",Telerehabilitation; arthroscopic subacromial decompression; physiotherapy; shoulder impingement syndrome; telemedicine,"5 Head of Physiotherapy at Rehabilitación Costa del Sol, Málaga, Spain.",en,NA,NA

Shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS) is the most frequent cause. Patients suffer pain, muscle weakness and loss of movement in the affected joint. Initial treatment is predominantly conservative. The surgical option has high success rates and is often used when conservative strategy fails. Traditional physiotherapy and post-operative exercises are needed for the recovery of joint range, muscle strength, stability and functionality. Telerehabilitation programmes have shown positive results in some orthopaedic conditions after surgery. Customized telerehabilitation intervention programmes should be developed to recover shoulder function after SIS surgery. The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a telerehabilitation intervention compared with usual care in patients after subacromial decompression surgery. METHODS: We will compare an intervention group receiving videoconferences and a telerehabilitation programme to a control group receiving traditional physiotherapy intervention in a single-blind, randomized controlled non-inferiority trial study design. DISCUSSION: Through this study, we will further develop our preliminary data set and practical experience with the telerehabilitation programmes to evaluate their effectiveness and compare this with traditional intervention. We will also explore patient satisfaction and cost-effectiveness. Patient enrolment is ongoing.

This review investigated one manual therapy approach, thrust manipulation, as a treatment option. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted of the electronic databases from inception to March 2016: PubMed, PEDro, ICL, CINAHL, and AMED. Two independent reviewers conducted the screening process to determine article eligibility. Inclusion criteria were manuscripts published in peer-reviewed journals with human participants of any age. The intervention included was thrust, or high-velocity low-amplitude, manipulative therapy directed to the shoulder and/or the regions of the cervical or thoracic spine. Studies investigating secondary shoulder pain or lacking diagnostic confirmation procedures were excluded. Methodological quality was assessed using the PEDro scale and the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. RESULTS: The initial search rendered 5041 articles. After screening titles and abstracts, 36 articles remained for full-text review. Six articles studying subacromial impingement syndrome met inclusion criteria. Four studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 2 were uncontrolled clinical studies. Five studies included 1 application of a thoracic spine thrust manipulation and 1 applied 8 treatments incorporating a shoulder joint thrust manipulation. Statistically significant improvements in pain scores were reported in all studies. Three of 4 RCTs compared a thrust manipulation to a sham, and statistical significance in pain reduction was found within the groups but not between them. Clinically meaningful changes in pain were inconsistent; 3 studies reported that scores met minimum clinically important difference, 1 reported scores did not, and 2 were unclear. Four studies found statistically significant improvements in disability; however, 2 were RCTs and did not find statistical significance between the active and sham groups. CONCLUSIONS: No clinical trials of thrust manipulation for non-surgical shoulder conditions other than subacromial impingement syndrome were found. There is limited evidence to support or refute thrust manipulation as a solitary treatment for this condition. Studies consistently reported pain reduction, but active treatments were comparable to shams. High-quality studies of thrust manipulation with safety data, longer treatment periods and follow-up outcomes are needed.",Chiropractic; Manual therapy; Non-surgical; Shoulder; Shoulder impingement syndrome; Spinal manipulation; Thrust manipulation,"Private Practice, South West Rocks, NSW 2431 Australia.",en,Review,NA

In this randomized study, we investigated whether operative treatment protects from later rotator cuff rupture and whether it has any effect on the development of rotator cuff muscle volume. Patients and methods - 140 stage-II impingement patients were randomized to a structured exercise group (n = 70) or to an operative group (n = 70). In the operative group, arthroscopic acromioplasty was performed, after which a similar structured exercise program was begun. MRI of the shoulder was done at baseline and at 5 years. Results - There were no statistically significant differences in either the amount of perforating ruptures of the supraspinatus tendon or in the changes in muscle volume at 5 years. The grading of muscle fatty degeneration showed worse results in the operative group, but this difference was not statistically significant. Interpretation - In this study, we found that arthroscopic acromioplasty does not have any long-term benefit based on radiological findings of muscle volumes.

This review is one of a series of reviews that form an update of the Cochrane review, 'Physiotherapy interventions for shoulder pain'. OBJECTIVES: To synthesise available evidence regarding the benefits and harms of manual therapy and exercise, alone or in combination, for the treatment of people with rotator cuff disease. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 3), Ovid MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2015), Ovid EMBASE (January 1980 to March 2015), CINAHL Plus (EBSCO, January 1937 to March 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP clinical trials registries up to March 2015, unrestricted by language, and reviewed the reference lists of review articles and retrieved trials, to identify potentially relevant trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials, including adults with rotator cuff disease, and comparing any manual therapy or exercise intervention with placebo, no intervention, a different type of manual therapy or exercise or any other intervention (e.g. glucocorticoid injection). Interventions included mobilisation, manipulation and supervised or home exercises. Trials investigating the primary or add-on effect of manual therapy and exercise were the main comparisons of interest. Main outcomes of interest were overall pain, function, pain on motion, patient-reported global assessment of treatment success, quality of life and the number of participants experiencing adverse events. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted the data, performed a risk of bias assessment and assessed the quality of the body of evidence for the main outcomes using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included 60 trials (3620 participants), although only 10 addressed the main comparisons of interest. Overall risk of bias was low in three, unclear in 14 and high in 43 trials. We were unable to perform any meta-analyses because of clinical heterogeneity or incomplete outcome reporting. One trial compared manual therapy and exercise with placebo (inactive ultrasound therapy) in 120 participants with chronic rotator cuff disease (high quality evidence). At 22 weeks, the mean change in overall pain with placebo was 17.3 points on a 100-point scale, and 24.8 points with manual therapy and exercise (adjusted mean difference (MD) 6.8 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.70 to 14.30 points; absolute risk difference 7%, 1% fewer to 14% more). Mean change in function with placebo was 15.6 points on a 100-point scale, and 22.4 points with manual therapy and exercise (adjusted MD 7.1 points, 95% CI 0.30 to 13.90 points; absolute risk difference 7%, 1% to 14% more). Fifty-seven per cent (31/54) of participants reported treatment success with manual therapy and exercise compared with 41% (24/58) of participants receiving placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.39, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.03; absolute risk difference 16% (2% fewer to 34% more). Thirty-one per cent (17/55) of participants reported adverse events with manual therapy and exercise compared with 8% (5/61) of participants receiving placebo (RR 3.77, 95% CI 1.49 to 9.54; absolute risk difference 23% (9% to 37% more). However adverse events were mild (short-term pain following treatment).Five trials (low quality evidence) found no important differences between manual therapy and exercise compared with glucocorticoid injection with respect to overall pain, function, active shoulder abduction and quality of life from four weeks up to 12 months. However, global treatment success was more common up to 11 weeks in people receiving glucocorticoid injection (low quality evidence). One trial (low quality evidence) showed no important differences between manual therapy and exercise and arthroscopic subacromial decompression with respect to overall pain, function, active range of motion and strength at six and 12 months, or global treatment success at four to eight years. One trial (low quality evidence) found that manual therapy and exercise may not be as effective as acupuncture plus dietary counselling and Phlogenzym supplement with respect to overall pain, function, active shoulder abduction and quality life at 12 weeks. We are uncertain whether manual therapy and exercise improves function more than oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), or whether combining manual therapy and exercise with glucocorticoid injection provides additional benefit in function over glucocorticoid injection alone, because of the very low quality evidence in these two trials.Fifty-two trials investigated effects of manual therapy alone or exercise alone, and the evidence was mostly very low quality. There was little or no difference in patient-important outcomes between manual therapy alone and placebo, no treatment, therapeutic ultrasound and kinesiotaping, although manual therapy alone was less effective than glucocorticoid injection. Exercise alone led to less improvement in overall pain, but not function, when compared with surgical repair for rotator cuff tear. There was little or no difference in patient-important outcomes between exercise alone and placebo, radial extracorporeal shockwave treatment, glucocorticoid injection, arthroscopic subacromial decompression and functional brace. Further, manual therapy or exercise provided few or no additional benefits when combined with other physical therapy interventions, and one type of manual therapy or exercise was rarely more effective than another. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Despite identifying 60 eligible trials, only one trial compared a combination of manual therapy and exercise reflective of common current practice to placebo. We judged it to be of high quality and found no clinically important differences between groups in any outcome. Effects of manual therapy and exercise may be similar to those of glucocorticoid injection and arthroscopic subacromial decompression, but this is based on low quality evidence. Adverse events associated with manual therapy and exercise are relatively more frequent than placebo but mild in nature. Novel combinations of manual therapy and exercise should be compared with a realistic placebo in future trials.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1990 to 2015. Two independent reviewers critically appraised studies using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network criteria. We used best evidence synthesis to synthesize evidence from studies with low risk of bias. RESULTS: We screened 5885 articles, and 19 were eligible for critical appraisal. Ten randomized controlled trials had low risk of bias. For persistent subacromial impingement syndrome, multimodal care leads to similar outcomes as sham therapy, radial extracorporeal shock-wave therapy, or surgery. For subacromial impingement syndrome, multimodal care may be associated with small and nonclinically important improvement in pain and function compared with corticosteroid injections. For rotator cuff tendinitis, dietary-based multimodal care may be more effective than conventional multimodal care (exercise, soft tissue and manual therapy, and placebo tablets). For nonspecific shoulder pain, multimodal care may be more effective than wait list or usual care by a general practitioner, but it leads to similar outcomes as exercise or corticosteroid injections. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence suggests that combining multiple interventions into 1 program of care does not lead to superior outcomes for patients with subacromial impingement syndrome or nonspecific shoulder pain. One randomized controlled trial suggested that dietary-based multimodal care (dietary advice, acupuncture, and enzyme tablets) may provide better outcomes over conventional multimodal care.

For patients with difficulty returning to usual activities, special efforts may be needed to improve shoulder function. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness at 3 and 12 months of a standardized physical therapy exercise intervention compared with usual care in patients with difficulty returning to usual activities after subacromial decompression surgery. DESIGN: A multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted. SETTING: The study was conducted in 6 public departments of orthopedic surgery, 2 departments of occupational medicine, and 2 physical therapy training centers in Central Denmark Region. PATIENTS: One hundred twenty-six patients reporting difficulty returning to usual activities at the postoperative clinical follow-up 8 to 12 weeks after subacromial decompression surgery participated. INTERVENTION: A standardized exercise program consisting of physical therapist-supervised individual training sessions and home training was used. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the Oxford Shoulder Score. Secondary outcome measures were the Constant Score and the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire. RESULTS: At 3 and 12 months, follow-up data were obtained for 92% and 83% of the patients, respectively. Intention-to-treat analyses suggested a between-group difference on the Oxford Shoulder Score favoring the exercise group at 3 months, with an adjusted mean difference of 2.0 (95% confidence interval=-0.5, 4.6), and at 12 months, with an adjusted mean difference of 5.8 (95% confidence interval=2.8, 8.9).

Objectives To determine and compare responsiveness and minimal clinically important change of the modified Constant score (CS) and the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS). Background The OSS and the CS are commonly used to assess shoulder outcomes. However, few studies have evaluated the measurement properties of the OSS and CS in terms of responsiveness and minimal clinically important change. Methods The study included 126 patients who reported having difficulty returning to usual activities 8 to 12 weeks after arthroscopic decompression surgery for subacromial impingement syndrome. The assessment at baseline and at 3 months included the OSS, the CS, and the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-3 Level (EQ-5D-3L) index. Responsiveness was assessed as follows: by correlation analysis between the change scores of the OSS, CS, and EQ-5D-3L index, and the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale; by receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve analysis using the PGIC scale as an external anchor; and by effect-size statistics. Results At 3 months, a follow-up assessment of 112 patients (89%) was conducted. The change scores of the CS and the OSS were more strongly correlated with the external anchor (PGIC scale) than the change score of the EQ-5D-3L index. The areas under the ROC curves exceeded 0.80 for both shoulder scores, with no significant differences between them, and comparable effect-size estimates were observed for the CS and the OSS. Minimal clinically important change ROC values were 6 points for the OSS and 11 points for the CS, with upper 95% cutoff limits of 12 and 22 points, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: Determine the effectiveness of exercise for shoulder pain. METHODS: We searched seven databases from 1990 to 2015 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort and case control studies comparing exercise to other interventions for shoulder pain. We critically appraised eligible studies using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) criteria. We synthesized findings from scientifically admissible studies using best-evidence synthesis methodology. RESULTS: We retrieved 4853 articles. Eleven RCTs were appraised and five had a low risk of bias. Four studies addressed subacromial impingement syndrome. One study addressed nonspecific shoulder pain. For variable duration subacromial impingement syndrome: 1) supervised strengthening leads to greater short-term improvement in pain and disability over wait listing; and 2) supervised and home-based strengthening and stretching leads to greater short-term improvement in pain and disability compared to no treatment. For persistent subacromial impingement syndrome: 1) supervised and home-based strengthening leads to similar outcomes as surgery; and 2) home-based heavy load eccentric training does not add benefits to home-based rotator cuff strengthening and physiotherapy. For variable duration low-grade nonspecific shoulder pain, supervised strengthening and stretching leads to similar short-term outcomes as corticosteroid injections or multimodal care. CONCLUSION: The evidence suggests that supervised and home-based progressive shoulder strengthening and stretching are effective for the management of subacromial impingement syndrome. For low-grade nonspecific shoulder pain, supervised strengthening and stretching are equally effective to corticosteroid injections or multimodal care.

Arthroscopic acromioplasty is popular even though its efficacy is unknown. In this study, we analyzed stage-II shoulder impingement patients in subgroups to identify those who would benefit from the operation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a previous randomized study, 140 patients were either treated with a supervised exercise program or with arthroscopic acromioplasty followed by a similar exercise program. The patients were followed up at 2 and 5 years after randomization. Self-reported pain was used as the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: Both treatment groups had less pain at 2 and 5 years, and this was similar in both groups. Duration of symptoms, marital status (single), long periods of sick leave, and lack of professional education appeared to increase the risk of persistent pain despite the treatment. Patients with impingement with radiological acromioclavicular (AC) joint degeneration also had more pain. The patients in the exercise group who later wanted operative treatment and had it did not get better after the operation. INTERPRETATION: The natural course probably plays a substantial role in the outcome. Based on our findings, it is difficult to recommend arthroscopic acromioplasty for any specific subgroup. Regarding operative treatment, however, a concomitant AC joint resection might be recommended if there are signs of AC joint degeneration. Even more challenging for the development of a treatment algorithm is the finding that patients who do not recover after nonoperative treatment should not be operated either.",NA,"c 3 Kanta-Häme Central Hospital , Hämeenlinna.",en,NA,NA

However, a comprehensive treatment comparison is lacking. Several widely used electronic databases were searched for eligible studies. The outcome measurements were the pain score and the Constant-Murley score (CMS). Direct comparisons were performed using the conventional pair-wise meta-analysis method, while a network meta-analysis based on the Bayesian model was used to calculate the results of all potentially possible comparisons and rank probabilities. Included in the meta-analysis procedure were 33 randomized controlled trials involving 2300 patients. Good agreement was demonstrated between the results of the pair-wise meta-analyses and the network meta-analyses. Regarding nonoperative treatments, with respect to the pain score, combined treatments composed of exercise and other therapies tended to yield better effects than single-intervention therapies. Localized drug injections that were combined with exercise showed better treatment effects than any other treatments, whereas worse effects were observed when such injections were used alone. Regarding the CMS, most combined treatments based on exercise also demonstrated better effects than exercise alone. Regarding surgical treatments, according to the pain score and the CMS, arthroscopic subacromial decompression (ASD) together with treatments derived from it, such as ASD combined with radiofrequency and arthroscopic bursectomy, showed better effects than open subacromial decompression (OSD) and OSD combined with the injection of platelet-leukocyte gel. Exercise therapy also demonstrated good performance. Results for inconsistency, sensitivity analysis, and meta-regression all supported the robustness and reliability of these network meta-analyses. Exercise and other exercise-based therapies, such as kinesio taping, specific exercises, and acupuncture, are ideal treatments for patients at an early stage of SIS. However, low-level laser therapy and the localized injection of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are not recommended. For patients who have a long-term disease course, operative treatments may be considered, with standard ASD surgery preferred over arthroscopic bursectomy and the open surgical technique for subacromial decompression. Notwithstanding, the choice of surgery should be made cautiously because similar outcomes may also be achieved by the implementation of exercise therapy.",NA,"From the Department of Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery (WD, Z-LW, T-YZ), Central Hospital of PetroChina, Langfang, Hebei, China; Department of Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery (WD, CB, KW, KK), University Hospital Bonn, Bonn; Department of Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery (HG), Hospital Wermelskirchen, Wermelskirchen, Germany; Department of Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery (X-BL), Rizhao People's Hospital, Rizhao, Shandong, China; Department of Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery (CP), Evangelic Wald-Krankenhaus, Bonn, Germany; and Department of Fundamental Science (Z-CJ), North China Institute of Aerospace Engineering, Langfang, Hebei, China.",en,Review,NA

Selection criteria were randomized and quasirandomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared platelet-rich therapy with either placebo, autologous whole blood, dry needling, or no platelet-rich therapy for people with acute or chronic musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries. Primary outcomes were functional status, pain, and adverse effects. The investigators found 19 studies that compared platelet-rich therapy with placebo, autologous whole blood, dry needling, or no platelet-rich therapy. Disorders included rotator cuff tears (arthroscopic repair; 6 trials); shoulder impingement syndrome surgery (1 trial); elbow epicondylitis (3 trials); anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (4 trials), ACL reconstruction (donor graft site application; 2 trials), patellar tendinopathy (1 trial), Achilles tendinopathy (1 trial), and acute Achilles rupture surgical repair (1 trial). They further subdivided the studies based on type of treatment, including tendinopathies in which platelet-rich therapy injections were the main treatment (5 trials), and surgical augmentation procedures in which platelet-rich therapy was applied during surgery (14 trials). The conclusion was that there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of platelet-rich therapy for treating musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries. Researchers contemplating RCTs should consider the coverage of currently ongoing trials when assessing the need for future RCTs on specific conditions. There is a need for standardization of PRP preparation methods. At this time, the use of PRP in foot and ankle surgery as an orthobiologic does not have an absolute indication. Many of the studies are lower evidence-based from surgical techniques. Several in vitro studies have shown that growth factors promote the regeneration of bone, cartilage, and tendons. More clinical studies are needed to evaluate the use of PRP as an orthobiologic.

METHODS: Eighty-seven patients with subacromial impingement syndrome (SAIS) were randomised into open acromioplasty (OS group), arthroscopic acromioplasty (AS group) or physiotherapy (PT group) treatment. The assessments comprised the Constant score, the Watson and Sonnabend score, the SF-36 evaluation and a clinical examination performed by an independent observer. Fifty-five patients attended the clinical follow-up. RESULTS: The groups were comparable at baseline in terms of demographics and clinical assessments. No significant differences in terms of the clinical assessments or health-related quality of life (QoL) were found between the study groups at follow-up. The Constant score had improved significantly at follow-up in both the OS group and the AS group (p = 0.003 and 0.008, respectively). At follow-up, the OS group revealed improved strength compared with before intervention (p = 0.012). All groups revealed a significantly improved internal rotation (OSG p = 0.01, ASG p = 0.005, PTG p = 0.004). The SF-36 was significantly improved in some scales within all three groups. The Watson and Sonnabend score was significantly improved in 12/14 questions for the OS group, in 5/14 questions for the AS group and in 6/14 for the PT group (p < 0.02 OS group vs. AS group, p < 0.05 OS group vs. PT group). CONCLUSION: In this randomised study, the Constant score, other clinical assessments and subjective health-related QoL revealed no significant differences between the 3 groups two to three years after intervention in patients with SAIS.

The purposes of the present study were to investigate whether the results were maintained after 1 year and whether the baseline Constant-Murley score, rotator cuff status and radiological findings influenced the outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 97 patients on the waiting list for arthroscopic subacromial decompression had been randomised to a specific exercise programme or unspecific exercises (controls). After 3 months of exercises, the patients were asked whether they still wanted surgery and this option was available until a 1-year follow-up. 1 year after inclusion or 1 year after surgery, the number of patients who decided to have surgery in each group was compared. The choice of surgery was related to the baseline Constant-Murley score, ultrasound and radiographs taken at inclusion. RESULTS: All patients had improved significantly (p<0.0001) in the Constant-Murley score at the 1-year follow-up. Significantly more patients in the control group decided to have surgery (63%) than those in the specific exercise group (24%; p<0.0001). Patients who decided to have surgery had a significantly lower baseline Constant-Murley score and more often a full-thickness tear. Patients with partial tears did not differ from those with intact tendons. INTERPRETATION: The positive short-term results of specific exercises were maintained after 1 year, and this exercise strategy reduces the need for surgery. Full-thickness tear and a low baseline Constant-Murley score appear to be a predictive marker for a less good outcome.

A recent Danish study showed that 10% of a nationwide cohort of patients retired prematurely within two years after surgery. Few studies have compared effects of different postoperative exercise programmes on shoulder function, and no studies have evaluated workplace-oriented interventions to reduce postoperative work disability. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of physiotherapy exercises and occupational medical assistance compared with usual care in improving shoulder function and reducing postoperative work disability after arthroscopic subacromial decompression. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a mainly pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial. The trial is embedded in a cohort study of shoulder patients referred to public departments of orthopaedic surgery in Central Denmark Region. Patients aged ≥18-≤63 years, who still have shoulder symptoms 8-12 weeks after surgery, constitute the study population. Around 130 participants are allocated to: 1) physiotherapy exercises, 2) occupational medical assistance, 3) physiotherapy exercises and occupational medical assistance, and 4) usual care. Intervention manuals allow individual tailoring. Primary outcome measures include Oxford Shoulder Score and sickness absence due to symptoms from the operated shoulder. Randomisation is computerised with allocation concealment by randomly permuted block sizes. Statistical analyses will primarily be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. DISCUSSION: The paper presents the rationale, design, methods, and operational aspects of the Shoulder Intervention Project (SIP). SIP evaluates a new rehabilitation approach, where physiotherapy and occupational interventions are provided in continuity of surgical episodes of care.

We hypothesised that a dose of 40 mg dexamethasone would improve analgesia after outpatient shoulder surgery compared with 8 mg. METHODS: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at Horsens Regional Hospital, Denmark. Patients scheduled for arthroscopic subacromial decompression and/or acromioclavicular joint resection as an outpatient procedure (n = 101) were randomised to receive intravenous dexamethasone 40 mg (D40), 8 mg (D8) or placebo (D0) before surgery. The primary outcome was pain intensity 8 h after surgery rated on a numeric rating scale of 0 to 10. Secondary outcomes were pain intensity, analgesic consumption and side effects during the first 3 days after surgery. RESULTS: Data from 73 patients were available for analysis: (D40: 25, D8: 26, D0: 22 patients). Eight hours after surgery, pain intensity were: [median (interquartile range)] group D40: 2 (1-4), group D8: 2.5 (1-5), group D0: 4 (2-7). There was no significant difference in pain intensity between group D40 and D8 after 8 h (P = 0.46) or at any other time. When comparing all three groups, a statistically significant dose-response relationship was seen for present, average and worst pain intensity after 8 h and on the following morning. No differences were found in analgesic consumption. No serious side effects were observed. CONCLUSION: Although our data supported a dose-response relationship, increasing the dexamethasone dose from 8 to 40 mg did not improve analgesia significantly after outpatient shoulder surgery.",NA,"Department of Orthopaedics, Horsens Regional Hospital, Horsens, Denmark.",en,Research Article,NA

These therapies can be used as the principal treatment or as an augmentation procedure (application after surgical repair or reconstruction). Platelet-rich therapies are produced by centrifuging a quantity of the patient's own blood and extracting the active, platelet-rich, fraction. The platelet-rich fraction is applied to the injured tissue; for example, by injection. Platelets have the ability to produce several growth factors, so these therapies should enhance tissue healing. There is a need to assess whether this translates into clinical benefit. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of platelet-rich therapies for treating musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (25 March 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2013 Issue 2), MEDLINE (1946 to March 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 Week 12) and LILACS (1982 to March 2012). We also searched trial registers (to Week 2 2013) and conference abstracts (2005 to March 2012). No language or publication restrictions were applied. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared platelet-rich therapy with either placebo, autologous whole blood, dry needling or no platelet-rich therapy for people with acute or chronic musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries. Primary outcomes were functional status, pain and adverse effects. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed each study's risk of bias. Disagreement was resolved by discussion or by arbitration by a third author. We contacted trial authors for clarification of methods or missing data. Treatment effects were assessed using risk ratios for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) for continuous data, together with 95% confidence intervals. Where appropriate, data were pooled using the fixed-effect model for RR and MD, and the random-effects model for SMD. The quality of the evidence for each outcome was assessed using GRADE criteria. MAIN RESULTS: We included data from 19 small single centre trials (17 randomised and two quasi-randomised; 1088 participants) that compared platelet-rich therapy with placebo, autologous whole blood, dry needling or no platelet-rich therapy. These trials covered eight clinical conditions: rotator cuff tears (arthroscopic repair) (six trials); shoulder impingement syndrome surgery (one trial); elbow epicondylitis (three trials); anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (four trials), ACL reconstruction (donor graft site application) (two trials), patellar tendinopathy (one trial), Achilles tendinopathy (one trial) and acute Achilles rupture surgical repair (one trial). We also grouped trials into 'tendinopathies' where platelet-rich therapy (PRT) injections were the main treatment (five trials), and surgical augmentation procedures where PRT was applied during surgery (14 trials). Trial participants were mainly male, except in trials including rotator cuff tears, and elbow and Achilles tendinopathies.Three trials were judged as being at low risk of bias; the other 16 were at high or unclear risk of bias relating to selection, detection, attrition or selective reporting, or combinations of these. The methods of preparing platelet-rich plasma (PRP) varied and lacked standardisation and quantification of the PRP applied to the patient.We were able to pool data for our primary outcomes (function, pain, adverse events) for a maximum of 11 trials and 45% of participants. The evidence for all primary outcomes was judged as being of very low quality.Data assessing function in the short term (up to three months) were pooled from four trials that assessed PRT in three clinical conditions and used four different measures. These showed no significant difference between PRT and control (SMD 0.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.19 to 0.71; P value 0.26; I² = 51%; 162 participants; positive values favour PRT). Medium-term function data (at six months) were pooled from five trials that assessed PRT in five clinical conditions and used five different measures. These also showed no difference between groups (SMD -0.09, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.39; P value 0.72; I² = 50%; 151 participants). Long-term function data (at one year) were pooled from 10 trials that assessed PRT in five clinical conditions and used six different measures. These also showed no difference between groups (SMD 0.25, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.57; P value 0.12; I² = 66%; 484 participants). Although the 95% confidence intervals indicate the possibility of a poorer outcome in the PRT group up to a moderate difference in favour of PRT at short- and long-term follow-up, these do not translate into clinically relevant differences.Data pooled from four trials that assessed PRT in three clinical conditions showed a small reduction in short-term pain in favour of PRT on a 10-point scale (MD -0.95, 95% CI -1.41 to -0.48; I² = 0%; 175 participants). The clinical significance of this result is marginal.Four trials reported adverse events; another seven trials reported an absence of adverse events. There was no difference between treatment groups in the numbers of participants with adverse effects (7/241 versus 5/245; RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.59; I² = 0%; 486 participants).In terms of individual conditions, we pooled heterogeneous data for long-term function from six trials of PRT application during rotator cuff tear surgery. This showed no statistically or clinically significant differences between the two groups (324 participants).The available evidence is insufficient to indicate whether the effects of PRT will differ importantly in individual clinical conditions. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, and for the individual clinical conditions, there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of PRT for treating musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries.

DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Science Citation Index databases were searched in March 2013 unrestricted by date or language. STUDY SELECTION: Controlled randomized (RCT) or quasi-randomized clinical trials comparing surgery and conservative treatment of shoulder impingement were included. DATA EXTRACTION: The methodological quality of each included trial was assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration's domain-based evaluation framework. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of seven included RCTs, risk of systematic bias was considered to be low for two, high for four, and unclear for one RCT. The random-effect meta-analysis was conducted on four RCTs involving 347 subjects (173 surgically treated cases and 174 controls). There was no significant difference in changes in pain intensity between surgically and conservatively treated subjects (Hedges's g = 0.01 in favor of conservative treatment, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.30). CONCLUSION: Based on the review of seven RCTs, the evidence on effectiveness of surgical or conservative treatment of shoulder impingement was found to be limited. There was, however, moderate evidence that surgical treatment is not more effective than active exercises on reducing pain intensity caused by shoulder impingement. Implications for Rehabilitation Based on the review of seven RCTs, the evidence on effectiveness of surgical or conservative treatment of shoulder impingement was found to be limited. There was moderate evidence that surgical treatment is not more effective than active exercises on reducing pain intensity caused by shoulder impingement. Because of surgery's higher costs and susceptibility for complications compared with costs and risks of conservative treatment, conservative treatment can be recommended as a first choice of treatment of shoulder impingement in first or second grade.",Acromioplasty; effectiveness; exercise; pain; rehabilitation shoulder impingement; rotator cuff; shoulder pain; surgery; treatment,Department of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine and.,en,Review,NA

However, it has never been used as a preventive tool. We investigated the use of MI in the rehabilitation of stage II shoulder impingement syndrome. For the first time, MI is used before surgery. METHOD: Sixteen participants were randomly assigned to either a MI or control group. Shoulder functional assessment (Constant score), range of motion and pain were measured before and after intervention. RESULTS: Higher Constant score was observed in the MI than in the control group (p=0.04). Participants in the MI group further displayed greater movement amplitude (extension (p<0.001); flexion (p=0.025); lateral rotation (p<0.001). Finally, the MI group showed greater pain decrease (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: MI intervention seems to alleviate pain and enhance mobility, this is probably due to changes in muscle control and consequently in joint amplitude. MI might contribute to postpone or even protect from passing to stage III that may require surgery.

Neurocognitive rehabilitation has shown to be highly effective after surgical reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. However, its effects in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome have not yet been established. AIM: The aim of the study was to compare the effects of neurocognitive therapeutic exercise, based on proprioception and neuromuscular control, on pain and function in comparison to traditional therapeutic exercise in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome. DESIGN: Single-blind randomized, non-inferiority clinical trial. SETTING: Outpatient clinic of Geriatrics and Physiatrics, University Hospital. POPULATION: Forty-eight patients with shoulder impingement syndrome (Neer stage I) and pain lasting for at least three months. METHODS: Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to either neurocognitive therapeutic exercise or traditional therapeutic exercise. Both treatments were provided one-hour session, three times a week for five weeks. The primary outcome measure was the short form of the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire (Quick-DASH questionnaire) for the assessment of physical ability and symptoms of the upper extremity. SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Constant-Murley shoulder outcome score for the determination of range of motion, pain and strength; American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Society standardized shoulder assessment form for the evaluation of physical ability in daily-living tasks; a visual analogue scale for pain assessment at rest and during movements; Likert score for the estimation of participant satisfaction. ENDPOINTS: before treatment, end of treatment, 12 and 24 weeks after the completion of each intervention for all outcome measures, except for the Likert score that was evaluated only at the end of treatment. FOLLOW-UP: 24 weeks. RESULTS: At the end of treatment and at follow-up, both treatment groups experienced improvements in all outcomes measures relative to baseline values, except for the visual analogue scale at rest that was unaffected by traditional therapeutic exercise. For all outcome measures, changes over time were greater in the neurocognitive therapeutic exercise group relative to the traditional therapeutic exercise group. The level of satisfaction with treatment was higher for participants in the neurocognitive therapeutic exercise group. CONCLUSION: Neurocognitive rehabilitation is effective in reducing pain and improving function in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome, with benefits maintained for at least 24 weeks.

Treatment includes surgical and non-surgical modalities. Non-surgical treatment is used to reduce pain, to decrease the subacromial inflammation, to heal the compromised rotator cuff and to restore satisfactory function of the shoulder. To select the most appropriate non-surgical intervention and to identify gaps in scientific knowledge, we explored the effectiveness of the interventions used, concentrating on the effectiveness of physiotherapy and manual therapy. METHODS: The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, PEDro and CINAHL were searched for relevant systematic reviews and randomised clinical trials (RCTs). Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality. A best-evidence synthesis was used to summarise the results. RESULTS: Two reviews and 10 RCTs were included. One RCT studied manual therapy as an add-on therapy to self-training. All other studies studied the effect of physiotherapy: effectiveness of exercise therapy, mobilisation as an add-on therapy to exercises, ultrasound, laser and pulsed electromagnetic field. Moderate evidence was found for the effectiveness of hyperthermia compared to exercise therapy or ultrasound in the short term. Hyperthermia and exercise therapy were more effective in comparison to controls or placebo in the short term (moderate evidence). For the effectiveness of hyperthermia, no midterm or long-term results were studied. In the midterm, exercise therapy gave the best results (moderate evidence) compared to placebo or controls. For other interventions, conflicting, limited or no evidence was found.

DATA SOURCES: Using terms including randomized controlled trial (RCT), shoulder impingement syndrome, rotator cuff impingement, and interventions, the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, PEDro, and CINAHL were searched up to February 2009. STUDY SELECTION: Relevant systematic reviews and RCTs in any language that included patients with SIS that was not caused by systemic disease or acute trauma; that evaluated surgical or postsurgical treatment for SIS; that reported outcomes of pain, function, or recovery; and that had a follow-up of ≥ 2 weeks, were selected by 2 independent reviewers and confirmed by consensus. DATA EXTRACTION: Data on the study population, interventions, outcome measures, and length of follow-up (6 months) were extracted. Two reviewers assessed the methods of the RCTs that were included in reviews other than Cochrane reviews and in RCTs published more recently, rating RCTs that met 6 of 12 Furlan criteria as high quality. The effectiveness of the intervention was rated as moderate, limited, or no evidence, depending on the consistency and quality of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: The included studies were 11 RCTs from a Cochrane review, an additional 2 RCTs that reported on the effectiveness of surgery for SIS, and 3 further RCTs that reported on postsurgical interventions. The quality of the studies was generally poor (10/11 RCTs in the Cochrane review had a high risk of bias; and 3 of the additional RCTs were rated moderate to low quality). Arthroscopic or open subacromial decompression compared with physiotherapy or exercise was investigated in 3 trials. No evidence for differences between the treatments in pain, function, or time to recovery was found in the short, medium, or long term. Five comparisons of arthroscopic versus open subacromial decompression showed no differences in pain or shoulder function scores at any follow-up assessment. One study found no difference in short- or long-term outcomes between arthroscopic versus open subacromial decompression for the removal of calcium deposits. A comparison of the Neer versus the modified Neer surgical technique found no verifiable difference between them in the short term. In a study comparing the techniques of electrocautery and holmium laser in arthroscopic subacromial decompression, differences favoring electrocautery were found for the short and medium term on one American shoulder rating scale but not on another. A high-quality study found no differences at any follow-up in pain or shoulder function scores when arthroscopic subacromial decompression was compared with radio-frequency-based plasma microtenotomy. A high-quality RCT compared injections of platelet-leukocyte gel given postoperatively with no injection. The additional intervention was effective at 6 weeks in reducing pain and improving shoulder function and range of motion, and in return to activities of daily living, but no differences were found in shoulder stability. Three low-quality studies compared the effectiveness of various postsurgical interventions. Early progressive exercises (range of motion, and strengthening exercises) resulted in greater improvements in range of motion at 3 and 12 months than later dynamic and strengthening exercise. Reductions in pain were similar for both groups. Patients taking ketoprofen (200 mg once daily for 6 weeks) compared with those taking placebo had less pain and better shoulder scale scores, active forward flexion, and active abduction, at 6 weeks but the groups did not differ after 2 years. The use of a pain pump (0.375% ropivacaine) after arthroscopic surgery was not effective in improving shoulder function scores at the 2-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Studies of surgical interventions in subacromial impingement syndrome suggested that no technique is convincingly better than another or than conservative interventions. Evidence from the few better quality studies suggested that injections of platelet-leukocyte gel given postoperatively were effective in the short term for lessening pain and improving shoulder function, and that radio-frequency-based plasma microtenotomy was not more effective than arthroscopic subacromial decompression for improving any outcome measure.",NA,"Department of Orthopaedics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.",en,NA,NA

METHODS: A total of 140 patients were randomly divided into two groups: 1) supervised exercise programme (n = 70, exercise group); and 2) arthroscopic acromioplasty followed by a similar exercise programme (n = 70, combined treatment group). RESULTS: The main outcome measure was self-reported pain as measured on a visual analogue scale. At the five-year assessment a total of 109 patients were examined (52 in the exercise group and 57 in the combined treatment group). There was a significant decrease in mean self-reported pain on the VAS between baseline and the five-year follow-up in both the exercise group (from 6.5 (1 to 10) to 2.2 (0 to 8); p < 0.001) and the combined treatment group (from 6.4 (2 to 10) to 1.9 (0 to 8); p < 0.001). The same trend was seen in the secondary outcome measures (disability, working ability, pain at night, Shoulder Disability Questionnaire and reported painful days). An intention-to-treat analysis showed statistically significant improvements in both groups at five years compared with baseline. Further, improvement continued between the two- and five-year timepoints. No statistically significant differences were found in the patient-centred primary and secondary parameters between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the patient-centred primary and secondary parameters between the two treatment groups were not statistically significant, suggesting that acromioplasty is not cost-effective.

METHODS: Sixty patients with rotator cuff disease scheduled for elective arthroscopic shoulder surgery were enrolled in the study. For the treatment of postoperative pain, 30 patients constituted group F and received a 12.0-μg/h fentanyl patch for 72 hours and saline solution infusion in a subacromial manner at the rate of 4 mL/h. The remaining 30 patients constituted group B and received a placebo patch and an infusion of 2.5-mg/mL bupivacaine in a subacromial manner for 72 hours. The primary outcome measure was the postoperative numerical rating scale pain score. The consumption of opioids, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen was also recorded. The Constant scores and general recovery were followed up until the 90th postoperative day. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the numerical rating scale scores (P = .60) between the groups. No differences in the use of rescue analgesic were observed except that the patients receiving bupivacaine used more ibuprofen (median, 1,200 mg v 600 mg) during the day of surgery (P = .042). No difference was found in general recovery between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: A fentanyl patch delivering 12-μg/h fentanyl offers an easy and safe treatment option as a part of multimodal analgesia with few adverse effects in the treatment of postoperative pain in a carefully selected patient group after arthroscopic shoulder surgery.

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with 3 months of follow-up. Participants and the single assessor were blinded to group assignment. Sample size was calculated with 80% power to show a minimum clinically important difference of 10% on the Constant–Murley score at P ≤ 0.05. SETTING: Tertiary study in Linköping, Sweden, between January 2008 and February 2010. PARTICIPANTS: Patients on the waiting list for arthroscopic subacromial decompression were recruited from the Department of Orthopaedics at University Hospital. Inclusion criteria were 30-65 years of age; a 6-month duration of the current episode of pain in the proximal-lateral aspect of the upper arm; lack of response to conservative treatment; and positive results on the Neer test and 2 of the following tests: Hawkins-Kennedy, Jobes, and Patte. Exclusion criteria were other conditions such as malignancy, osteoarthritis, osacromiale, joint instability, frozen shoulder,and symptoms originating in the spine; a history of fractures or surgery in the shoulder complex; and corticosteroid injections to the shoulder within the previous 3 months. INTERVENTION: Both the intervention and control groups received a subacromial corticosteroid injection at the inclusion visit. Exercises supervised by a physiotherapist commenced 2 weeks after the injection. There were 7 sessions over the next 2 weeks, and participants were instructed to do the exercises daily at home for 12 weeks and to keep exercise diaries. The control exercise program included 6 unspecific nonprogressive movement and stretching exercises for the neck and shoulder with no external load. Exercises for the intervention group were 2 eccentric exercises for the rotator cuff, 3 concentric/eccentric exercises for the scapula stabilizers, and a posterior shoulder stretch. The strengthening exercises were repeated 15 times in 3 sets, twice daily, for 8 weeks, with the stretch repeated every set. During weeks 9 to 12, the exercises were repeated once a day. The exercises progressed with increasing external load modified by the level of pain that the patient reported. Good posture was emphasized. After 12 weeks, continuation of the exercises for 2 months was recommended. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measure was shoulder function and pain assessed after 3 months by the Contant–Murley score (0-100, worst to best shoulder function). Additional measures were the disabilities of the arm,shoulder, and hand (DASH) score and visual analog pain scores. The patients rated their global impression of the effectiveness of their treatment, and they were asked whether they felt that they still needed arthroscopic subacromial decompression.The analysis included 97 of 102 randomized patients. MAIN RESULTS: After 3 months were greater for the intervention group than the control group (72.5 vs 52.5) with the mean difference in change favoring the intervention group (mean difference,15 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.5-20.6). The intervention group also improved more on the DASH score (mean difference between groups, 8 points; 95% CI, 2.3-13.7) and on pain at night but not on pain during activity or at rest. The groups did not differ in changes in health-related quality of life. More patient sin the intervention group than the control group reported a successful outcome of treatment (35/51 vs 11/46; odds ratio, 7.6; 95% CI, 3.1-18.9) and fewer chose subsequent surgery (10/51 vs 29/46; odds ratio, 7.7; 95% CI, 3.1-19.4).

Unfortunately, imaging studies have shown that after surgical repair re-rupture rate is potentially high. Literature data indicate that each of the components present in a commercial supplement sold in Italy as Tenosan * (arginine L-alpha-ketoglutarate, methylsulfonylmethane, hydrolyzed type I collagen and bromelain) have a potential role in tendon healing and mitigating the pain due to tendonitis. We evaluated the clinical and MRI results of rotator cuff repair with and without the employment of this oral supplement in patients with a large, postero-superior rotator cuff tear (RCT). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We enrolled 90 consecutive patients who had a large, postero-superior RCT. All the lesions were managed with an arthroscopic repair. Patients were randomized and treated either with (Group I) or without (Group II) the supplement. The primary outcomes were the difference between the pre- and post-operative Constant score and repair integrity assessed by MRI according to Sugaya's classification. The secondary outcome was the pre- and post-operative Simple Shoulder Test. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were identified between the two groups for each considered variable, except for shoulder pain (follow-up: 6 months) and repair integrity (final follow-up). Intensity of shoulder pain was lower in the Group I patients (p < 0.001). Analogously, in Group I, the percentage of patients with a better repair integrity result was significantly higher than Group II. CONCLUSION: The use of the supplement for 3 months after cuff repair decreases shoulder post-operative pain and leads to a slight improvement in repair integrity. This improvement does not seem to correlate with an better objective functional outcome. However, these effects could facilitate and abbreviate the post-operative rehabilitation program and reduce re-rupture rate. The main limitations of this study are the relative short follow-up period and small number of patients studied.",NA,"Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, University of Rome Sapienza, Rome, Italy. s.gumina@tiscali.it",en,NA,NA

DESIGN: Randomised, controlled trial with concealed allocation and blinded outcome assessment. SETTING: University hospital in Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 30 to 65 years with subacromial impingement syndrome of at least 6 months duration, and on the waiting listing for surgery were included. Key exclusion criteria included previous shoulder fractures, and frozen shoulder. Randomisation of 102 participants allocated 52 to the intervention exercise group and 50 to a control exercise group. INTERVENTIONS: Both groups received a subacromial corticosteroid injection at inclusion and commenced exercises 2 weeks later. Both groups visited a physiotherapist 7 times over 10 weeks and were prescribed home exercises for 12 weeks. The intervention exercise group were prescribed 6 exercises: 2 eccentric exercises for the rotator cuff, 3 concentric/ eccentric exercises for the scapula stabilisers, and a posterior shoulder stretch. Each strengthening exercise was repeated 15 times in 3 sets twice daily for 8 weeks and then once daily for 4 weeks. The stretch was completed for 30 to 60 seconds and repeated 3 times twice daily. Training load was progressed using weights or elasticised bands. The control group exercise program consisted of 6 non-specific movement exercises for the neck and shoulder (e.g. neck retraction, shoulder abduction). The control group exercises were not loaded or progressed and were completed 10 times 3 times daily. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the Constant shoulder score at 3 months. The Constant score is scored from 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating better function. Secondary outcome measures included the disability of the arm, shoulder and hand questionnaire (DASH), a visual analogue score for pain, the EuroQol quality of life instrument, and whether the participant thought they still needed surgery. RESULTS: 97 participants completed the study. At 3 months, the change in Constant score was significantly more in the specific exercise group than the control group by 15 (95% CI 8.5 to 20.6) points. The DASH improved significantly more in the intervention than the control group by 8 (95% CI 2.3 to 13.7) points. The intervention group also improved significantly more than the control group in ratings of night pain, and quality of life. A lower proportion of the specific exercise group subsequently chose surgery (20% v 63%, Number Needed to Treat 3, 95% CI 1.6 to 3.9). CONCLUSION: A specific, progressive exercise program focusing on training the rotator cuff and scapular stabilisers was effective in improving function, reducing pain and reducing the need of surgery for patients with chronic subacromial impingement syndrome.

Disorders of the shoulder muscles and tendons (rotator cuff) are thought to be the commonest cause of this pain. The long-term outcome is frequently poor despite treatment. This means that many patients are exposed to more invasive treatment, e.g. surgery, and/or long-term pain and disability.Patients with this disorder typically receive a course of physiotherapy which might include a range of treatments. Specifically the value of exercise against gravity or resistance (loaded exercise) in the treatment of tendon disorders is promising but appears to be under-used. Loaded exercise in other areas of the body has been favourably evaluated but further investigation is needed to evaluate the impact of these exercises in the shoulder and particularly the role of home based or supervised exercise versus usual treatment requiring clinic attendance. METHODS/DESIGN: A single-centre pragmatic unblinded parallel group randomised controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness of a self-managed loaded exercise programme versus usual clinic based physiotherapy. A total of 210 study participants with a primary complaint of shoulder pain suggestive of a rotator cuff disorder will be recruited from NHS physiotherapy waiting lists and allocated to receive a programme of self-managed exercise or usual physiotherapy using a process of block randomisation with sealed opaque envelopes. Baseline assessment for shoulder pain, function and quality of life will be undertaken with the Shoulder Pain & Disability Index, the Patient Specific Functional Scale and the SF-36. Follow-up evaluations will be completed at 3, 6 and 12 months by postal questionnaire. Both interventions will be delivered by NHS Physiotherapist's.An economic analysis will be conducted from an NHS and Personal Social Services perspective to evaluate cost-effectiveness and a qualitative investigation will be undertaken to develop greater understanding of the experience of undertaking or prescribing exercise as a self-managed therapy.

Platelet-rich fibrin matrix (PRFM) allows delivery of autologous cytokines to healing tissue, and limited evidence suggests a positive effect of platelet-rich plasma on tendon biology. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of platelet-rich fibrin matrix on rotator cuff tendon healing. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Seventy-nine patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff tendon repair were randomized intraoperatively to either receive PRFM at the tendon-bone interface (n = 40) or standard repair with no PRFM (n = 39). Standardized repair techniques were used for all patients. The postoperative rehabilitation protocol was the same in both groups. The primary outcome was tendon healing evaluated by ultrasound (intact vs defect at repair site) at 6 and 12 weeks. Power Doppler ultrasound was also used to evaluate vascularity in the peribursal, peritendinous, and musculotendinous and insertion site areas of the tendon and bone anchor site. Secondary outcomes included standardized shoulder outcome scales (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES] and L'Insalata) and strength measurements using a handheld dynamometer. Patients and the evaluator were blinded to treatment group. All patients were evaluated at minimum 1-year follow-up. A logistic regression model was used to predict outcome (healed vs defect) based on tear severity, repair type, treatment type (PRFM or control), and platelet count. RESULTS: Overall, there were no differences in tendon-to-bone healing between the PRFM and control groups. Complete tendon-to-bone healing (intact repair) was found in 24 of 36 (67%) in the PRFM group and 25 of 31 (81%) in the control group (P = .20). There were no significant differences in healing by ultrasound between 6 and 12 weeks. There were gradual increases in ASES and L'Insalata scores over time in both groups, but there were no differences in scores between the groups. We also found no difference in vascularity in the peribursal, peritendinous, and musculotendinous areas of the tendon between groups. There were no differences in strength between groups. Platelet count had no effect on healing. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that PRFM was a significant predictor (P = .037) for a tendon defect at 12 weeks, with an odds ratio of 5.8. CONCLUSION: Platelet-rich fibrin matrix applied to the tendon-bone interface at the time of rotator cuff repair had no demonstrable effect on tendon healing, tendon vascularity, manual muscle strength, or clinical rating scales. In fact, the regression analysis suggests that PRFM may have a negative effect on healing.

DESIGN: Randomised, participant and single assessor blinded, controlled study. SETTING: Department of orthopaedics in a Swedish university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 102 patients with long standing (over six months) persistent subacromial impingement syndrome in whom earlier conservative treatment had failed, recruited through orthopaedic specialists. INTERVENTIONS: The specific exercise strategy consisted of strengthening eccentric exercises for the rotator cuff and concentric/eccentric exercises for the scapula stabilisers in combination with manual mobilisation. The control exercise programme consisted of unspecific movement exercises for the neck and shoulder. Patients in both groups received five to six individual guided treatment sessions during 12 weeks. In between these supervised sessions the participants performed home exercises once or twice a day for 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the Constant-Murley shoulder assessment score evaluating shoulder function and pain. Secondary outcomes were patients' global impression of change because of treatment and decision regarding surgery. RESULTS: Most (97, 95%) participants completed the 12 week study. There was a significantly greater improvement in the Constant-Murley score in the specific exercise group than in the control exercise group (24 points (95% confidence interval 19 to 28.0) v 9 points (5 to 13); mean difference between group: 15 points (8.5 to 20.6)). Significantly more patients in the specific exercise group reported successful outcome (defined as large improvement or recovered) in the patients' global assessment of change because of treatment: 69% (35/51) v 24% (11/46); odds ratio 7.6, 3.1 to 18.9; P<0.001.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of subacromial bupivacaine infusion after arthroscopic acromionplasty and rotator cuff procedures. METHODS: Ninety patients with subacromial impingement disease scheduled for elective shoulder arthroscopy were enrolled in this randomized, prospective and placebo-controlled study. The patients received subacromially either 5.0 mg/ml bupivacaine or 9.0 mg/ml saline at the rate of 2 ml/h post-operatively for 48 h. The primary outcome measure was the use of rescue oxycodone. The consumption of opioids, ibuprofen, paracetamol and codeine, and the intensity of pain were recorded. RESULTS: Patients receiving bupivacaine infusion used significantly less oxycodone compared with patients receiving saline [15 vs. 20 mg (median) oxycodone intravenously on the day of surgery, 0 vs. 10 mg (median) perorally on the first post-operative day]. There was no significant difference in the use of ibuprofen, paracetamol and codeine, except that paracetamol was used more in patients receiving saline during the day of surgery (P = 0.009). The pain scores of patients receiving bupivacaine were lower at 18 h (P = 0.008). Average pain scores for the worst pain experienced did not differ between the groups. There were three (4%) premature discontinuations because of technical problems. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the low need of opioids, expenses and technical problems in these patients, subacromial 5.0 mg/ml bupivacaine infusion 2 ml/h confers only moderate and probably clinically insignificant efficacy compared with placebo.

No evidence was found for the superiority of subacromial decompression versus conservative treatment in the short, mid, and long term or in favor of 1 surgical technique when compared with another. Limited evidence was found in favor of early activation after arthroscopic decompression in the short and long term. CONCLUSIONS: This review shows that there is no evidence that surgical treatment is superior to conservative treatment or that 1 particular surgical technique is superior to another. Because of possibly lower risks for complications, conservative treatment may be preferred. When choosing for surgery, arthroscopic decompression may be preferred because of the less invasive character of the procedure.",NA,"Department of General Practice, Erasmus MC - University Medical Center Rotterdam, The Netherlands.",en,Review,NA

Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate whether better perioperative pain management could positively influence postoperative shoulder function. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial, 3 groups of patients--each with 15 participants--were treated with SSN block (10 mL of 1% ropivacaine), placebo, or a subacromial infiltration of local anesthesia (20 mL of 1% ropivacaine). Preoperative and postoperative pain was evaluated with a visual analog scale. Functional outcome was measured by the Constant-Murley score, and patient satisfaction was measured anecdotally by interview 2 days, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks after surgery. RESULTS: The SSN group reported significantly lower levels of postoperative pain, required significantly less analgesia, had better range of motion, and had higher levels of postoperative satisfaction in comparison to the subacromial infiltration group and placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with SSN blocks had less pain overall, which led to a decreased need for analgesics in comparison to the subacromial infiltration and placebo groups.

METHODS: Seventy-seven patients (age range, 30 to 55 years) with supraspinatus tendinopathy, were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups: a supervised exercise program (Group 1), a supervised exercise program combined with joint and soft tissue mobilization (Group 2), or a home-based rehabilitation program (Group 3). All patients had rehabilitation for 12 weeks. Pain level was evaluated with a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the range of motion (ROM) was measured with a goniometer. The Modified American Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (MASES) score was used in functional assessment. Flexion, abduction, internal and external rotation strengths were measured with a manual muscle test. All patients were evaluated before, and at the 4th and 12th week of the rehabilitation. RESULTS: All groups experienced significant decrease in pain and an increase in shoulder muscle strength and function by both the 4th and 12th weeks of treatment (p0.05). However, the greatest improvement in functionality was found in Group 2.

Optimal therapy for shoulder pain (SP) in primary care is yet unknown, since clinical history and physical examination do not provide decisive evidence as to the patho-anatomical origin of the symptoms. Optimal decision strategies can be furthered by applying ultrasound imaging (US), an accurate method in diagnosing SP, demonstrating a clear relationship between diagnosis and available therapies. Yet, the clinical cost-effectiveness of applying US in the management of SP in primary care has not been studied. The aim of this paper is to describe the design and methods of a trial assessing the cost-effectiveness of ultrasound imaging as a diagnostic triage tool to improve management of primary care patients with non-chronic shoulder pain. METHODS/DESIGN: This randomised controlled trial (RCT) will involve 226 adult patients with suspected subacromial disorders recruited by general practitioners. During a Qualification period of two weeks, patients receive care as usual as advised by the Dutch College of General Practitioners, and patients are referred for US. Patients with insufficient improvement qualify for the RCT. These patients are then randomly assigned to the intervention or the control group. The therapies used in both groups are the same (corticosteroid injections, referral to a physiotherapist or orthopedic surgeon) except that therapies used in the intervention group will be tailored based on the US results. Ultrasound diagnosed disorders include tendinopathy, calcific tendinitis, partial and full thickness tears, and subacromial bursitis. The primary outcome is patient-perceived recovery at 52 weeks, using the Global Perceived Effect questionnaire. Secondary outcomes are disease specific and generic quality of life, cost-effectiveness, and the adherence to the initial applied treatment. Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, 13, 26, 39 and 52 weeks after inclusion. An economic evaluation will be performed from both a health care and societal perspective with a time horizon of 52 weeks.

It is unclear whether one method is more effective than the other. OBJECTIVES: To compare compression plating and locked intramedullary nailing for primary surgical fixation (surgical fixation of an acute fracture or early fixation following failure of conservative treatment) of humeral shaft fractures in adults. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (February 2011), The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1, MEDLINE and EMBASE (both to February 2011) and trial registries for ongoing trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing compression plates and locked intramedullary nail fixation for humeral shaft fractures in adults. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial methodology and extracted data. Disagreement was resolved by discussion, or third party adjudication. Treatment effects were assessed using risk ratios for dichotomous data and mean differences for continuous data, together with 95% confidence intervals. Where appropriate, data were pooled using a fixed-effect model. MAIN RESULTS: Five small trials comparing dynamic compression plates with locked intramedullary nailing were included in this review. These involved a total of 260 participants undergoing surgery for either acute fractures or after early failure of conservative treatment. All five trials had methodological flaws, such as the lack of assessor blinding, that could have influenced their findings. There was no significant difference in fracture union between plating and nailing (five trials, RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.13). There was a statistically significant increase in shoulder impingement following nailing when compared with plating (five trials, RR 0.12; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.38). Intramedullary nails were removed significantly more frequently than plates (three trials, RR 0.17; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.76). There was no statistically significant difference between plating and nailing in operating time, blood loss during surgery, iatrogenic radial nerve injury, return to pre-injury occupation by six months or American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores.Two further small trials are awaiting classification. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence shows that intramedullary nailing is associated with an increased risk of shoulder impingement, with a related increase in restriction of shoulder movement and need for removal of metalwork. There was insufficient evidence to determine if there were any other important differences, including in functional outcome, between dynamic compression plating and locked intramedullary nailing for humeral shaft fractures.",NA,"Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, UK, HP21 8AL.",en,Review,NA

Lasting symptoms and impairment may occur when a subsequent atraumatic rotator cuff rupture is also present. However, degenerative ruptures of the rotator cuff can also be observed in asymptomatic elderly individuals. Treatment of these symptomatic degenerative ruptures may be conservative or surgical. Acceptable results are reported for both treatment modalities. No evidence-based level-1 studies have been conducted so far to compare these treatment modalities. The objective of this study is to determine whether there is a difference in outcome between surgical reconstruction and conservative treatment of a degenerative atraumatic rotator cuff tendon rupture. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Patients aged between 45 and 75 with a symptomatic atraumatic rotator cuff rupture as diagnosed by MRI will be included. Exclusion criteria are traumatic rotator cuff rupture, frozen shoulder and diabetes mellitus. Patients will be randomized into two groups. Conservative treatment includes physical therapy according to a standardized protocol, NSAIDs and, if indicated, subacromial infiltration with a local anesthetic and corticosteroids. Surgical reconstruction is performed under general anesthesia in combination with an interscalenus plexus block. An acromioplasty with reconstruction of the rotator cuff tendon is performed, as described by Rockwood et al. Measurements take place preoperatively and 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year postoperatively. The primary outcome measure is the Constant score. Secondary measures include both disease-specific and generic outcome measures, and an economic evaluation. Additionally, one year after inclusion a second MRI will be taken of all patients in order to determine whether extent and localization of the rupture as well as the amount of fatty degeneration are prognostic factors. DISCUSSION: Both surgical as conservative treatment of a symptomatic atraumatic rotator cuff tendon rupture is used in current practice. There is a lack of level-1 studies comparing surgical vs. conservative treatment. This randomized controlled trial has been designed to determine whether the surgical treatment of a degenerative atraumatic rotator cuff tendon rupture may lead to a better functional and radiological outcome than conservative treatment after one year of follow-up.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a specific rehabilitative protocol, integrated with the administration of a nutritional supplement, in the conservative rehabilitative treatment, as well as in post-surgery, of patients with lesions of the rotator cuff. Two groups with syndrome of the rotator cuff were formed to follow different therapeutic courses, in relation to the choice of each subject to undergo the conservative treatment (Arm A) or the surgical one (Arm B). In Arm A the study included the association of therapy with ESWT (shock waves) with the proprioceptive Multi Joint System, for rehabilitating joint movement and muscle strength of the shoulder, and a specific nutritional supplement to reduce the pain and conserve the cartilage tissue. Between February 2009 and June 2009, we enrolled 30 subjects (randomized into three homogenous groups A1, A2, A3), average age 45±10 years, with rotator cuff syndrome with calcification of the shoulder, diagnosed through clinical examination and investigative instruments (X-ray, echography or NMR). In Arm B, from September 2009 to January 2010, we enrolled 50 patients (randomized into two groups, B1 and B2), 24 male (average age 58.4: min 28 and max 78) and 26 females (average age 59.5: min 30 and max 80), who had undergone rotator cuff operations and acromionplasty for non-massive lesions without important gleno-humeral instability, with either open or arthroscopic procedures. The analysis of the results of Arm A highlights that in terms of reducing pain the main benefits were found in Group A1 where the supplement was given. From the analysis of the data of Arm B, in both groups an improvement of the first 4 items evaluated was evident. In Group B1, 84 percent of the patients declared to be satisfied and improved and 16 percent were dissatisfied; in Group B2, where the nutritional supplement was given, 92 percent were satisfied and 8 percent were dissatisfied.

Exercise in the treatment of rotator cuff impingement: a systematic review and a synthesized evidence-based rehabilitation protocol. J Shoulder Elbow Surg. 2009;18(1):138–160. CLINICAL QUESTION: What is the role of exercise in the treatment of rotator cuff impingement syndrome (RCIS), and what evidence-based exercises can be synthesized into a criterion-standard exercise rehabilitation protocol? DATA SOURCES: Investigations were identified by PubMed, Ovid, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, American College of Physicians Journal Club, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects. The search terms included shoulder, impingement, rotator cuff, rehabilitation, physical therapy, physiotherapy, and exercise. Additional searches were performed with bibliographies of retrieved studies. STUDY SELECTION: To qualify for inclusion, studies had to be level 1 or level 2 (randomized controlled trials); had to compare rehabilitation interventions, such as exercise or manual therapy, with other treatments or placebo; had to include validated outcome measures of pain, function, or disability; and had to be limited to individuals with diagnosed impingement syndrome. Impingement syndrome was determined by a positive impingement sign per Neer or Hawkins criteria, or both. Articles were excluded if they addressed other shoulder conditions (eg, calcific tendinosis, full-thickness rotator cuff tears, adhesive capsulitis, osteoarthritis), addressed postoperative management, were retrospective studies or case series, or used other outcome measures. DATA EXTRACTION: An evidence-based journal club of 9 faculty members and fellows reviewed the articles and extracted and tabulated the data. Individual outcomes for pain, range of motion (ROM), strength, and function were organized. Intragroup and between-groups outcomes were assessed for the effectiveness of treatment, and statistical outcomes were recorded when available. Clinical importance was determined when statistical value was P < .05 and the effect size or difference between treatments was 20% or more. Six major categories were created to organize the components of the physical therapy programs used in each study: ROM, flexibility and stretching, strengthening techniques, therapist-driven manual therapy, modalities, and schedule. Components from these categories were used to create a synthesized physical therapy program. MAIN RESULTS: The searches identified 80 studies, of which 11 met the inclusion criteria. In 5 studies, the diagnosis of RCIS was confirmed using an impingement test consisting of lidocaine injected into the subacromial space and elimination of pain with the impingement sign. Randomization methods were used in 6 studies, and blinded, independent examiners were involved in follow-up data collection in only 3 studies. Validated outcome measures were used in all studies. Follow-up was very good in 10 studies and was less than 90% in only 1 study. The specific exercise programs varied among studies. However, general treatment principles were identified among the different studies and included frequency, ROM, stretching or flexibility, strengthening, manual therapy (joint and/or soft tissue mobilizations), modalities, and others. The findings indicated that exercise improves outcomes of pain, strength, ROM impairments, and function in patients with impingement syndrome. In 10 studies, investigators reported improvements in pain with supervised exercise, home exercise, exercise associated with manual therapy, and exercise after subacromial decompression. Of the 6 studies in which researchers compared pre-exercise pain with postexercise pain, 5 demonstrated that exercise produced statistically significant and clinically important reductions in pain. Two studies demonstrated improvements in pain when comparing exercise and control groups. In 1 study, investigators evaluated bracing without exercise and found no difference in pain between the brace and exercise groups. Investigators evaluated exercise combined with manual therapy in 3 studies and demonstrated improvement in pain relief in each study and improvement in strength in 1 study. In most studies, exercise also was shown to improve function. The improvement in function was statistically significant in 4 studies and clinically meaningful in 2 of these studies. In 2 studies, researchers compared supervised exercise with a home exercise program and found that function improved in both groups but was not different between groups. This finding might have resulted from a type II statistical error. In 4 studies, researchers did not find differences between acromioplasty with exercise and exercise alone for pain alone or for outcomes of pain and function. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicated that exercise is beneficial for reducing pain and improving function in individuals with RCIS. The effects of exercise might be augmented with implementation of manual therapy. In addition, supervised exercise might not be more effective than a home exercise program. Many articles had methodologic concerns and provided limited descriptions of specific exercises, which made comparing types of exercise among studies difficult. Based on the results, Kuhn generated a physical therapy protocol using evidence-based exercise that could be used by clinicians treating individuals with impingement syndrome. This evidence-based protocol can serve as the criterion standard to reduce variables in future cohort and comparative studies to help find better treatments for patients with this disorder.",NA,"Boulder Center for Sports Medicine, CO 80304, USA. jfleming@bch.org",en,NA,NA

Physiotherapy is often the first choice of treatment although its effectiveness is still under debate. Systematic reviews in this field highlight the need for more high quality trials to investigate the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome. METHODS/DESIGN: This randomized controlled trial will investigate the effectiveness of individualized physiotherapy in patients presenting with clinical signs and symptoms of subacromial impingement, involving 90 participants aged 18-75. Participants are recruited from outpatient physiotherapy clinics, general practitioners, and orthopaedic surgeons in Germany. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to either individualized physiotherapy or to a standard exercise protocol using central randomization. The control group will perform the standard exercise protocol aiming to restore muscular deficits in strength, mobility, and coordination of the rotator cuff and the shoulder girdle muscles to unload the subacromial space during active movements. Participants of the intervention group will perform the standard exercise protocol as a home program, and will additionally be treated with individualized physiotherapy based on clinical examination results, and guided by a decision tree. After the intervention phase both groups will continue their home program for another 7 weeks. Outcome will be measured at 5 weeks and at 3 and 12 months after inclusion using the shoulder pain and disability index and patients' global impression of change, the generic patient-specific scale, the average weekly pain score, and patient satisfaction with treatment. Additionally, the fear avoidance beliefs questionnaire, the pain catastrophizing scale, and patients' expectancies of treatment effect are assessed. Participants' adherence to the protocol, use of additional treatments for the shoulder, direct and indirect costs, and sick leave due to shoulder complaints will be recorded in a shoulder log-book. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge this is the first trial comparing individualized physiotherapy based on a defined decision making process to a standardized exercise protocol.

DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials were searched electronically and manually from 1966 to December 2007. Study quality was independently assessed by 2 reviewers using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. If possible, relative risks and weighted mean differences were calculated for individual studies, and relative risks or standardized mean differences for pooled data, otherwise results were summarized in a best evidence synthesis. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included, with a mean quality score of 6.8 points out of 10. Many different diagnostic criteria for shoulder impingement syndrome were applied. Physio-therapist-led exercises and surgery were equally effective treatments for shoulder impingement syndrome in the long term. Also, home-based exercises were as effective as combined physiotherapy interventions. Adding manual therapy to exercise programmes may have an additional benefit on pain at 3 weeks follow-up. Moderate evidence exists that passive treatments are not effective and cannot be justified. CONCLUSION: This review shows an equal effectiveness of physiotherapist-led exercises compared with surgery in the long term and of home-based exercises compared with combined physiotherapy interventions in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome in the short and long term; passive treatments cannot be recommended for shoulder impingement syndrome. However, in general, the samples were small, and different diagnostic criteria were applied, which makes a firm conclusion difficult.

Arthroscopic acromioplasty provides no clinically important effects over a structured and supervised exercise programme alone in terms of subjective outcome or cost-effectiveness when measured at 24 months. Structured exercise treatment should be the basis for treatment of shoulder impingement syndrome, with operative treatment offered judiciously until its true merit is proven.",NA,"Kanta-Häme Central Hospital, Hämeenlinna, Finland.",en,NA,NA

But does surgery really lead to better results than nonoperative measures? This systematic review compared effects of conservative and surgical treatment for subacromial impingement syndrome in terms of improvement of shoulder function and reduction of pain. METHODS: A literature search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in PubMed, EMBASE, PEDro, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted. Two reviewers assessed the methodological quality of the selected studies. A best-evidence synthesis was used to summarize the results. RESULTS: Four RCTs were included in this review. Two RCTs had a medium methodological quality, and 2 RCTS had a low methodological quality. No differences in outcome between the treatment groups were reported for any of the studies, irrespective of quality. CONCLUSION: No high-quality RCTs are available so far to provide possible evidence for differences in outcome; therefore, no confident conclusion can be made. According to the best-evidence synthesis, however, there is no evidence from the available RCTs for differences in outcome in pain and shoulder function between conservatively and surgically treated patients with SIS.

METHODS: This prospective, randomized study included 50 patients: 25 patients had a 24-hour pain pump with 0.375% ropivacaine infusion and a continuous rate of 5 mL/h in the subacromial space after arthroscopic subacromial decompression, and 25 patients did not. Rehabilitation was similar in both groups. Evaluation methods were clinical examination, radiographic evaluation, and isometric elevation strength measurements, as well as the University of California, Los Angeles and Constant shoulder scores. All the operations were done by 1 experienced orthopaedic surgeon, and all the evaluations at follow-up were done by 1 independent, blinded examiner. There were no differences between the study groups preoperatively. Of the patients, 47 (94%) were available at a minimum follow-up of 2 years (range, 24 to 32 months). RESULTS: Concerning the duration of sick leave (P = .053) and ability to return to work (P = .321), the group differences were not statistically significant. At follow-up, the shoulder scores (University of California, Los Angeles and Constant) were significantly better than preoperatively (P < .001) in both groups, although no differences were found between the groups. The isometric elevation strengths of the operated shoulders were equally good in both groups (P = .976) as well, and no significant differences were observed between the operated shoulders and nonoperated shoulders at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: According to this study, the use of a pain pump after arthroscopic subacromial decompression did not have any long-term effects on the patients' recovery, return to work, or final result at the minimum 2-year follow-up.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and safety of surgery for rotator cuff disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Sports Discus, Science Citation Index (Web of Science) in March 2006 unrestricted by date or language. SELECTION CRITERIA: Only studies described as randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials (RCTs) studying participants with rotator cuff disease and surgical interventions compared to placebo, no treatment, or any other treatment were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent review authors assessed methodological quality of each included trial and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: We included 14 RCTs involving 829 participants. Eleven trials included participants with impingement, two trials included participants with rotator cuff tear and one trial included participants with calcific tendinitis. No study met all methodological quality criteria and minimal pooling could be performed. Three trials compared either open or arthroscopic subacromial decompression with active non operative treatment (exercise programme, physiotherapy regimen of exercise and education, or graded physiotherapy strengthening program). No differences in outcome between these treatment groups were reported in any of these trials. One trial which also included a placebo arm (12 sessions detuned soft laser) reported that the Neer score of participants in both active treatment arms improved significantly more than those who received placebo at six months. Six trials that compared arthroscopic with open subacromial decompression reported no significant differences in outcome between groups at any time point although four trials reported a quicker recovery and/or return to work with arthroscopic decompression. Adverse events, which occurred in three trials and included infection, capsulitis, pain, deltoid atrophy, and reoperation, did not differ between surgical groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based upon our review of 14 trials examining heterogeneous interventions and all susceptible to bias, we cannot draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness or safety of surgery for rotator cuff disease. There is ""Silver"" (www.cochranemsk.org) level evidence from three trials that there are no significant differences in outcome between open or arthroscopic subacromial decompression and active non-operative treatment for impingement.

METHODS: The institutional ethics committee approved the study design, and all patients signed informed consent forms. Patients (age range, 30 to 70 years) were considered for enrollment if 6 months of active conservative treatment had failed and they had Neer stage II impingement syndrome, positive radiographic evidence of type II acromion, and magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound evidence of supraspinatus tendinosis. Patients (N = 60) were randomly assigned to undergo arthroscopic subacromial decompression or RF-based plasma microtenotomy. For microtenotomy, a bipolar RF-based probe (TOPAZ; ArthroCare, Austin, TX) was used to perform microdebridement in the supraspinatus tendon; patients did not undergo acromioplasty. Outcomes evaluation consisted of self-reported pain via a visual analog scale, as well as functional assessment (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES] survey, Constant score, and University of California, Los Angeles [UCLA] questionnaire). Statistical analyses were performed by use of factorial dependent-measures analysis of variance tests. RESULTS: Age and baseline scores on the visual analog scale (mean +/- SD) were 52.0 +/- 6.7 and 53.2 +/- 6.6 years and 8.4 +/- 0.9 and 8.2 +/- 0.8 points in the microtenotomy and arthroscopic subacromial decompression groups, respectively. A significant reduction in pain (P < .001) and improved function (P < .001 for all measures) were observed in both groups postoperatively. Both treatment groups had almost identical longitudinal recovery profiles for pain relief (P = .416) and restoration of function (P = .964 for ASES score, P = .978 for Constant score, and P = .794 for UCLA score). At 1 year, the median pain score was 1.0, and all patients had ASES, Constant, and UCLA scores of greater than 90, greater than 80, and greater than 30, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Both procedures were associated with significant improvement postoperatively, but the RF-based plasma microtenotomy procedure draws into question the need for a more extensive procedure such as subacromial decompression in this patient population.

When conservative treatment of SIS fails, a subacromial decompression is warranted. However, the best moment of referral for surgery is not well defined. Both early and late referrals have disadvantages - unnecessary operations and smaller improvements in shoulder function, respectively. This paper describes the design of a new interdisciplinary treatment strategy for SIS (TRANSIT), which comprises rules to treat SIS in primary care and a well-defined moment of referral for surgery. METHODS/DESIGN: The effectiveness of an arthroscopic subacromial decompression versus usual medical care will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients are eligible for inclusion when experiencing a recurrence of SIS within one year after a first episode of SIS which was successfully treated with a subacromial corticosteroid injection. After inclusion they will receive injection treatment again by their general practitioner. When, after this treatment, there is a second recurrence within a year post-injection, the participants will be randomized to either an arthroscopic subacromial decompression (intervention group) or continuation of usual medical care (control group). The latter will be performed by a general practitioner according to the Dutch National Guidelines for Shoulder Problems. At inclusion, at randomization and three, six and 12 months post-randomization an outcome assessment will take place. The primary outcome measure is the patient-reported Shoulder Disability Questionnaire. The secondary outcome measures include both disease-specific and generic measures, and an economic evaluation. Treatment effects will be compared for all measurement points by using a GLM repeated measures analyses. DISCUSSION: The rationale and design of an RCT comparing arthroscopic subacromial decompression with usual medical care for subacromial impingement syndrome are presented.

Effectiveness of rehabilitation for patients with subacromial impingement syndrome: a systematic review. J Hand Ther. 2004;17: 152–164. Clinical Question: Which physical rehabilitation techniques are effective in reducing pain and functional loss for patients with subacromial impingement syndrome (SAIS)? Data Sources: Investigations were identified by MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Register searches from 1966 through October 2003 and by hand searching the references of all retrieved articles and relevant conference proceedings. The search terms were shoulder, shoulder impingement syndrome, bursitis, and rotator cuff combined with rehabilitation, physical therapy, electrotherapy, ultrasound, exercise, and acupuncture and limited to clinical trial, random assignment, or placebo. Study Selection: Inclusion criteria involved randomized controlled trials or clinical trials comparing nonsurgical, nonpharmacologic physical interventions for patients with SAIS with another intervention, no treatment, or a placebo treatment. Included studies required clinically relevant and well-described outcome measures of pain, disability, or functional loss. The study was limited to adult patients who met specific inclusion criteria for the signs and symptoms of SAIS and exclusion criteria for systemic impairment, cervical involvement, degenerative joint changes, clinical findings of other shoulder injury, previous history of surgery or physical therapy treatment, and workers' compensation claim/litigation. Data Extraction: A 23-item checklist, with each item assigned 0, 1, or 2 quality points for a total of 46 possible points, was used independently by 2 examiners to assess each study. In their original report, Michener et al stated that the 23-item checklist was worth a possible 69 points. However, in a conversation with L. A. Michener, she stated that this was an inadvertent publication error and confirmed that the possible point value for this checklist was indeed 46. This checklist encompasses 7 major areas, including the rationale for the research question, study design, subjects, intervention, outcome, analysis, and recommendations. If a discrepancy of more than 1 quality point was present for any item, the 2 investigators discussed it to reach a consensus. The total quality points were summed for each independent evaluator, and the average of the 2 final scores was used to determine the total quality score for an individual study. Main Results: The specific search criteria identified a total of 635 papers for review, of which only 12 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for study. The average total quality score of these 12 studies was 37.6 (range, 33.5–41) of 46 possible points. Analysis of the inclusion criteria for SAIS revealed that shoulder pain was present in all 12 trials, painful or weak resisted abduction was present in 7 trials, positive Neer test was present in 6 trials, painful arc was present in 5 trials, positive Hawkins-Kennedy test was present in 4 trials, painful or weak resisted shoulder internal and external rotation in 4 trials, and positive impingement injection test was present in 2 trials. Physical interventions, performed in isolation or in combination, for patients with SAIS were divided into 5 types: exercise, joint mobilization, ultrasound, acupuncture, and laser. Authors employed a variety of outcomes measures, with all studies using a numeric rating or visual analog scale for pain, a direct measure of functional loss or disability (in 10 of 12 studies), or an indirect measure of a global rating of change or a measure of strength in a functional position (in 2 of 12 studies). Therapeutic exercise was the most widely studied form of physical intervention and demonstrated short-term and long-term effectiveness for decreasing pain and reducing functional loss. Upper quarter joint mobilizations in combination with therapeutic exercise were more effective than exercise alone. Laser therapy is an effective single intervention when compared with placebo treatments, but adding laser treatment to therapeutic exercise did not improve treatment efficacy. The limited data available do not support the use of ultrasound as an effective treatment for reducing pain or functional loss. Two studies evaluating the effectiveness of acupuncture produced equivocal results. Conclusions: These data indicate that exercise, joint mobilization, and laser therapy are effective physical interventions for decreasing pain and functional loss or disability for patients with SAIS. The current evidence does not support the use of ultrasound, and studies evaluating the effectiveness of acupuncture were equivocal. The number of trials evaluating the effectiveness of physical rehabilitation interventions for patients with SAIS is limited, and those available are of moderate quality. Clinicians should interpret the conclusions with these limitations in mind.",NA,"Department of Sports Health Care, Arizona School of Health Sciences, A. T.

METHODS: Randomised controlled trial with 12 months' follow up in a hospital setting. Ninety consecutive patients aged 18 to 55 years were enrolled. Symptom duration was between six months and three years. All fulfilled a set of diagnostic criteria for rotator cuff disease, including a positive impingement sign. Patients were randomised either to arthroscopic subacromial decompression, or to physiotherapy with exercises aiming at strengthening the stabilisers and decompressors of the shoulder. Outcome was shoulder function as measured by the Constant score and a pain and dysfunction score. ""Intention to treat"" analysis was used, with comparison of means and control of confounding variables by general equation estimation analysis. RESULTS: Of 90 patients enrolled, 84 completed follow up (41 in the surgery group, 43 in the training group).

DATA SOURCE: Reports up to October 2002 were located from MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), the TRIP database, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) using ""shoulder"" and ""clinical trial""/""randomized controlled trial"" as search terms. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if (1) they were a randomized controlled trial; (2) they were related to impingement syndrome, rotator cuff tendinitis, or bursitis; (3) one of the treatments included therapeutic exercise or manual therapy. DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent observers reviewed the methodological quality of the studies using an assessment tool developed by the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group. Differences were resolved by consensus. DATA SYNTHESIS: Seven trials met our inclusion criteria. After consensus, the mean methodological score for all studies was 13.9 +/- 2.4 (of 24). Four studies of 7, including the 3 trials with the best methodological score (67%), suggested some benefit of therapeutic exercise or manual therapy compared with other treatments such as acromioplasty, placebo, or no intervention. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence to support the efficacy of therapeutic exercise and manual therapy to treat impingement syndrome.

METHOD: 40 patients with subacromial impingement I/II were randomized to two groups. Group 1 performed a mostly isometric self-training after instruction by a physiotherapist, group 2 received prescriptions for physiotherapy and ""strengthening exercises for the rotator cuff"". Follow up was performed after 6 and 12 weeks with the use of the constant score (unpondered). Patient satisfaction with the treatment was controlled by VAS (1 - 6). RESULT: After 12 weeks, patients of group 1 had performed the exercises 5 x/week for 15 minutes. Patients of group 2 had received 30 sessions in average. Patients of group 1 improved from a mean of 59 points (39.5 - 86) to a mean of 68 points (37 - 88) after 6 and 75 points (65 - 90) after 12 weeks. Patients of group 2 improved from 60.5 points (41 - 83) to 67 points (39.5 - 92) and 72 points (43 - 93), respectively. Patient satisfaction was higher in the self-training group (1.9 : 2.8).

The criterion for a successful outcome of treatment was a reduction of the initial pain score of more than 50% using the visual analogue scale (VAS) technique. The evaluation was performed by an independent observer. At the 6-month follow-up, treatment in the surgical group had been successful in 12/21 (57%) patients versus 6/18 (33%) in the physiotherapy group. A one-year evaluation revealed 16/21 (76%) ""successes"" in the surgical group. A direct and unbiased comparison with the physiotherapy group was not possible at one year, since 13 patients chose surgery after initial physiotherapy. However, in ""an intention to treat"" analysis outcome at one year was significantly better in those randomized to surgery. We found two standardized, composite, active movements--the ""Pour out of a Pot"" manoeuvre requiring the emptying of a pot of water, and the ""Hand in Neck"" manoeuvre--to be of predictive value for the outcome of surgery. When combining three pain-related variables into a criterion for prediction of success, a sensitivity of 78% (p < 0.02) and a specificity of 90% (p < 0.03) were attained. We advance the hypothesis that pain in the impingement syndrome is mainly elicited by comparison of the subacromial bursa.
